 Welcome to the Jewelry Connoisseur podcast. And now your host, Sonja Esther Soltani.  Today we're going to go on a journey through the history of Ukrainian jewelry. Our guest is Olga Olenksenko. Olga is the founder of Strong and Precious. Olga tells us about the designers, why they are distinctively Ukrainian, what's meaningful about their jewelry. But she also takes us back on a trip back to where Ukrainian jewelry started. It's a fascinating conversation that links the past to the present and I hope you enjoy it.  So welcome on this podcast Olga. We're going to discuss strong and precious but we're first going to go back to the beginning of the history of Ukrainian jewelry. Hi Sonya, it's a real pleasure to be here with you today and thank you for having me. So when does Ukrainian jewelry start and what are typical materials that you'd like to share with us, typical techniques and part of the history of the national jewelry? Thank you Sonya for the question. We, Ukrainians,  are very ancient nation and the art of jewelry in Ukraine, bends back to the ancient times, tracing its roots to the new stone age or even earlier. As you can see, it's a long way of evolution of the national style and it developed under their influences over the Tripelian and Schizian cultures throughout the BC era. So it's very ancient cultures and it evolves further during the medieval  state of Kiev, Rus'. In the 16th and 17th centuries, jewelry craftsmanship developed throughout Ukraine, but especially in two jewelry centers, Lviv and Kiev. The jewelers of these cities formed a national school employing techniques like casting, forging, engraving. Also that time, the artistry of enamels developed, showing a rich-colored palette of complex techniques.  As pensions and church constructions surged during these times, increased demand of religious items. And of course, the spirit of Ukrainian Baroque heavily influenced the creation of sophisticated jewelry. Of course, you heard about European Western Baroque, but Ukrainian Baroque wasn't as lush as Western European. It has calmer ornaments and somewhat simplified forms,  by local flora. All the traditional jewelries were adorned with intricate ornaments, floral designs, birds and trees, and each carrying a unique meaning for the wearer. I think it would be interesting for the listeners to know something about types of traditional Ukrainian jewelry. Firstly, there is an amysto. It's a necklace predominantly made of beads, pearls, corals.  often in shades of red. Our ancestors believed that the Namisto had protective qualities against evil forces and the materials it was made of defined the woman's society status. Another very famous piece is Lunitsa. It's an amulet jewelry resembling a new moon. Women trusted these amulets to shield them from negativity and to attract prosperity.  Of course, we have the famous hryvnia, it is the name of our national currency. And before it was a necklace crafted from gold or silver. The warriors in 10th and 11th centuries received the neck hryvnia as a reward. During 12th and 14th centuries, the necklace hryvnia gradually turned into an exclusively female decoration. Also, there is the dukach necklace and  It's the necklace featuring coins. And women creatively use chains or beads to ornament these coins and creating more sophisticated look.  important and people loved this jury so much so they couldn't compete with him. So can you tell us a bit more about him that people might have heard of but maybe don't know his full story?  He lived and worked in Kiev in the end of the 19th, beginning of the 20th century. The work of our project and our work ethic is inspired by his example. He is one of the few that has a lasting legacy in jewelry. Luckily, some of his archives were kept by his family, who fled the revolution and continued his legacy first in France and later in the United States. He was a very important person in the history of jewelry.  an incredibly talented jewelry, a true visionary working in Kyiv. He came to Kyiv to study jewelry craftsmanship and began his career as a chainmaker. Later, the motives of the chains became the part of his original style even in high jewelry. He was talented and successful and continued to develop and increase his business. At the top of his career, he had 92 buildings in Kyiv. Can you imagine  So it wasn't just boutiques. It was training centers. It was workshops. He was more than just successful jeweler brand. He was a visionary and held many progressive values. That is why he is our inspiration. He opened training centers for his employees to constantly improve their skills and hence the quality of the pieces they produced. Another curious aspect is that he was the first  to work with many women artisans who were paid equally to men. That is why he can be called one of the first feminists, not only in Ukraine, but in the world also. Overall, he represented Ukraine on the international scene, exhibitions in Germany, Chicago, Antwerp, where he was rewarded with diplomas and medals. And he created the competition with the international brands there.  For these reasons he is an inspiration to my work at Strong and Precious. We also aim to represent Ukraine on the international scene and we want our designers to be appreciated globally. We are also planning to put greater focus on educating our jewellers to help them to develop and advance in their craft further.  of  the heritage of your country. Thank you, Sonja, for the question again. Strong and Precious is a project about a place, a land, and a culture. And this is our main inspiration. It's a project that was born from a tragedy, the war in Ukraine, which didn't stop. And it is our response to the war, not an armed response, but an artistic response. And we want to show globally how creative  harmonious and artistic our nation is, how rich our cultural heritage, despite the challenges of war. For our project, we intentionally choose the designers with the distinctive individuality to display the diversity within our nation and common culture. All designers, each of them has its own style and uses its own techniques and materials. However, it is not the technique  and materials which makes them typically Ukrainian. I think that the distinctive feature of our designers is having meaning in every piece and it is the influence of our heritage. In Ukraine we have traditional patterns that are full of meanings. Each symbol means something. They also differ from region to region. We could find it in our traditional design clothing, but it's  It's also in our jewelry. And the creations of contemporary Ukrainian jewelers are imbued by this vivid symbolism. Yet they look very contemporary. I'll make examples from the designers that we represented. For example, Oberik Jewelry. They used motifs of Ukrainian embroidery, recreating these patterns in precious stones. Designer Irina Karpova created the collection celebrating our traditional  of decorating Easter eggs with the patterns. You know that we have this tradition to decorate Easter eggs unlike other nations and she recreates these patterns in jewelry and in enamel. So also I see designers being inspired by Ukrainian traditional ceramics. Brand Gunya created a necklace celebrating the ancient Tripilion culture. Traditional Ukrainian ceramics  also became an inspiration for this Banak collection by Yuval Studio that we presented at the GemGenev last November. But our designers work not only with the traditional patterns. For New York City Jewelry Week, also the last November, we gave everybody a topic, the modern symbols of Ukraine. And it is very interesting to see how designers improvised on this topic. Of course, it's very difficult to describe jewelry  without showing them, but I invite everybody to go to our website and to look at these unique pieces. One of them I'm wearing, it's incredible brooch links, which is made by Inessa Kovaleva, a very young and very talented Ukrainian designer. Inessa has got a master's degree in architecture, and if I had not mentioned it, you would have guessed it already. Pure geometry and  the  modern contemporary way. Also we had very beautiful necklace by Nomis, it's the other. They created freedom black pearl necklace. Here they talk about the intellectual capacity of our nation. The fact is that the pearls in this necklace are set not in the chaotic order. The word freedom is encrypted in binary code here. And as you know binary code is the language of  of programmers. Ukrainian programmers are well known all over the world and are hired by biggest global IT companies. She just explained the intellectual capacity of our nation. So you can see how contemporary brands make an interpretation of Ukrainian symbols in their own very individual way. This is very moving. A lot of these symbols and very powerful as well.  Thanks, Olga, for highlighting some of these pieces. And I also want to add that it became clear now that for Ukrainians what they wear and how they adorn themselves is definitely not only about decoration but about communicating profound messages. And this is the distinguishing feature of Ukrainian jewelry. What about the actual Ukrainian jewelry market right now in Ukraine since the Russian invasion?  things have changed. A lot of the people, part of strong and precious, don't live in Ukraine anymore, are based all over the world in the US, in Europe. What about the craftspeople? What's happening to them right now?  the situation is leveling out, especially in the larger cities and those far from military theater. Despite all the horrors of the war, people still want to have positive emotions and make their loved ones happy. Let's also remember that all the international brands like Cartier, Graf, Van Cleef and Arpels, close their boutiques in Ukraine. And this has definitely contributed to the fact that people started to buy products  from Ukrainian designers. Another very important aspect is that people now want to wear Ukrainian jewelry to emphasize their national identity and contribute to the growth of the country's economy. In Ukraine, we even have some examples of huge commercial success with the local jewelry brands during this period. Maybe you heard Luzena find jewelry. They are sold very well now and they are commercially  The situation is not the same bright for everyone in the industry, of course. Smaller producers struggle with the increase in prices for precious materials like gold, for example, and access to these materials is also limited. That's why they started to use more brass, bronze, silver. There are also some more terrible aspects of working in countries where I think the  actual war is taking place. A workshop of one of our jewelers suffered from bombing in the first months of the war and they were forced to stop production. And at the end of 2022, a series of blackouts happened when the jewelers simply couldn't start the equipment to melt metal because we had the big problems with electricity. There is also a lack of staff due to the physical absence of talented hands.  artisans left the country and some of them became the part of army to defend the country. So nevertheless, most of the jewelry that we represent at Strong and Precious is created in Ukraine. The jewelry industry in Ukraine is very young, but it is led by very talented people and we don't want that war to take away their future. We want our jewelers to have an opportunity to work and develop inside the country, in  their country.  is to see our exhibitions presented at the most important art venues internationally. Maybe it sounds very ambitious, but I'd love for Ukrainian jewelers to be showcased in Metropolitan Museum in New York, in Boston Fine Art Museum, or in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. It sounds like, you know, a dream, but I really make plans about them.  I would be happy if the prestigious venues could support us and provide us with these spaces and with the help to make such an exhibition. It's a part of my idea that jewelry is an art, not a craft, and it's museum-worthy. In Ukraine, we have so many creative ideas, and I'd love to see all of them to be realized. I also dream of curating a big exhibition  dedicated to Marschak, who really deserves big venues also. But of course, I want to integrate our contemporary jewellers into such an exhibition. Even if my aspiration for strong and precious are not directly tied to commerce, I'd love to see the creations of our talented Ukrainian designers on this place at the most prestigious department stores and galleries around the world. And if you want to support  designers by now, you can buy buying their pieces on their websites directly. And one of our brands, NOMIS, I already told about them, they are represented at Dover Street Market in New York, Los Angeles and London. So you can find them there and support them by buying their pieces. And I sincerely hope that each brand participating in our project achieves significant commercial success.  and our foundation will help them to achieve more popularity worldwide. That's fantastic. I wish you all the best of luck, Olga. I want to say I've seen the jewelry firsthand. I've been lucky to see it in Geneva. It's extremely crafted. It's innovative and really, really extraordinary designers. So I wish strong and precious designers all the best. And I'm so grateful to you, Olga, to take the time to tell us about your art foundation and about the history of your Korean jewelry today. Thank you.  Thank you, Sonja.
