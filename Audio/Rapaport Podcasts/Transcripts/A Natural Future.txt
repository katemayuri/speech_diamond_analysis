 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Joshua Friedman.  jewelry wholesaler called a few headlines this summer, when it said it would no longer offer its asset memo support program to retailers that carry or promote lab grown diamonds. I asked Josh about this policy and how the market reacted and also about his views on the state of the jewelry sector ahead of the holidays. Enjoy the episode.  I could just start by asking a bit about your company. Can you tell me about Arazi Diamonds? What's your history? Arazi is a family-run business. It's primarily me and my father that run the business day to day. We just celebrated our 25th anniversary last year. We are in the fine jewelry sector. Everything that we do, we're proud to say, we manufacture in-house in New York City. And our products are available at some of the finer stores in America. And we do business in the Middle East, some parts of Europe.  Europe, South America now. And really when my father started out, he wanted to specialize in perfecting the eternity band, which we've done a great job there. Our footprint eternity band world is very large. And we've since expanded into other jewelry. And we don't only deal with diamonds, we deal with diamonds, we deal with emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. A few other gems like paraibas and everything is made in platinum and 18 karat gold.  to have the finest quality available to offer something unique and we consider ourselves a boutique brand. So I was doing a little bit of research yesterday actually on what we've said about you in the past and the two topics in the context of which Rappaport have covered you recently, one of them was eternity bands like you mentioned and the other one was fancy shapes. Can you tell me the extent to which you focus on those? So as far as eternity band goes, I think we have the largest inventory in the country. We have a very large selection as far  shapes and sizes and we're not afraid to try new things. Like we have marquee shaped eternity bands that you don't really see so many of. Everything is perfectly matched. Everything we know we take our time into making every band for every stone to look like one another. You know we're not that volume manufacturers so you know we take our time in making a piece perfecting it. We experiment with different metals and mixing two metals together. We just release at this point  past Couture Show in Vegas, we released a new setting that we've done where the inner band is, let's say, in 18 karat rose gold, but from the top, it looks like it's in platinum because we've mixed those two metals together and it's a very nice touch. And that's how we continuously try to stand out from the other attorney bands out there. As far as tennis bracelets, we do very well with the classic crown, but we have a very nice selection when it comes to emerald cut.  Do you sell also loose diamonds or just finished jewelry? And can you tell us a bit about how you source diamonds and how do you make sure that your diamonds are from legitimate sources and what's your method for procuring goods?  So we rarely bring in a new vendor for loose diamonds. Rarely do we do that. The reason being is that we have very strong relationships. We have strong partnerships with the diamond deals that we work with today. And some of them have turned to not diamond deals anymore. They're on a very large scale, world renowned. Many of them are side holders, but every one of them is vetted and you know, it's clean business. We make sure of it. We source our diamonds in Israel.  in Israel, in Belgium, in India, and we're very happy with each diamond partner. The event that prompted me to take an interest in your company and then to invite you on the podcast was this press release that your company sent out about six weeks ago. We were recording this on September the 3rd and this press release was sent out on July the 25th that you will no longer be supplying or selling through retailers that carry or promote lab-grown diamonds. Could you just explain exactly what was this change of policy or, firstly, was it a change of policy and why did you do this?  What I want to specifically mention is that we stopped offering those retailers an asset memo program. As long as someone is well vetted, they can purchase anything they like from our company. But we do offer an asset memo program that allows us to park some merchandise at their store that is not paid for that we're stopping to do. We won't continue doing that with those stores. The reason why we stopped is we've never gotten into Lapron. It was never even a thought.  And the way that it's been going you look a few years ago where the prices have been the price of today.  consumer. So we want to remove ourselves from that. The other reason is that as a long term play, the ones that are carrying lab going today, I don't see them to be our partners in 10 years from now. And that's for sure. I don't even see them to be our partner today. Their sales have been going down based on the sales reports that we get every month. So why would I continue to park my merchandise in a place that's not performing well? Throughout the year, we cease our asset memo program with dealers for other reasons. And one of the reasons could be  that sales are going down for whatever the reason is. So we do pull our merchandise back. But this happened to be that it was for that reason. And we don't want our merchandise to be parked in the same store where you have lab-grown diamonds. The consumers are losing confidence in that store. You know, if they want something natural, they're a little hesitant, you know, what if they mix it? They may go somewhere else. Really, the truth of the matter is, I think those retailers, they're doing a big mistake. Yes, the margins are good, but you're chasing pennies. The margins are good at a bodega.  But you're ringing up $10 at a time. We as a brand, we keep on raising our minimum entry level and not so much so that, you know, in a few years, my lowest ticket item is going to be $50,000. Not like that. But I also keep on raising our next level of ticket. A few years ago, I didn't have any pieces in my inventory for a million dollars. Today I have quite a few. And in 10 years from now, I could definitely see us hitting the eight figures for a single piece of jewelry. The other thing I want to also mention is that these retailers  made up for less than 5% of our business. But that 5% focused on a better tier store is having my chips in the right place and I think will pay off much better for our business.  in social media, for example, that natural diamond prices have also fallen and there is still demand for lab grown and it's growing, it's going to become a bigger and bigger chunk of the total market. And actually it's a sector with a future and a very sensible sector to be in. So how do you respond to that approach? Look, lab grown, I have nothing against lab grown diamonds. I just, I don't believe that they belong in the same store where I'm selling my jewelry. I think lab grown diamonds is a good product. But if you have a store that's designated to only selling  lab grown. It could be a great business model. Further, it's a perfect item for a Walmart to carry, a raw stores to carry, TJ Maxx, Target, the price where it's heading today where stones are selling for $50 to $100 a carat in all sizes. It's a perfect product for their clientele. Now, do I see the demand growing even more? I definitely do. But I think as you go on, as the price drops, it's going to take less of a percentage of the real engagement  engagement ring sales, meaning, you know, quality engagement ring sales. The other thing about diamond's prices are also falling. Yes, right now I feel like we're going through a correction. The price have gone up significantly during the COVID era and now they slowly dropping and they're correcting, but they're not dropping anywhere near the prices of lab growth. The other thing I want to say is that the percentage that I feel the percentage of the lab grown sales that are happening  is the higher you go ticket price or ticket price even for a loose diamond is the less chances of that customer picking a lab grown over they are picking a natural diamond. In the one carat range, one and a half carat range, yes, you have a large percentage that prefer a lab grown diamond because at that level they're not really looking to buy an asset. But when you go three, four carats and higher, I think those sales are weak when you look at the lab grown. Right. And we have seen  It's difficult to generalize. I think we've seen that the very large stones over five carrots, for example, have suffered less in the recent downturn than the bread and butter sizes. In the natural, over five carrots, finely made stones, especially fancy shapes, are doing very well with us. Emerald cuts, ovals, matched pair of pear shapes are doing phenomenal right now. Do you think that's because lab-grown is affecting it less than with other sizes, or is there something else going on? No, I don't think so at all. I think that sector of the market  There's a lot of appetite. The Hine-Atworth clientele, they're always looking to extend their jewelry collection. And, you know, fondly made stones have always sold, even in a downturn. Right. What about other synthetic gemstones? What's your approach to those? Your asset memo program, would you offer that to a jeweler that sells synthetic emeralds? To be honest with you, I don't think any of the stores that I work with today carry synthetic emeralds, rubies and sapphires. I don't think that they do.  because those are also easily recognizable, those synthetic gems. They kind of look like they're not natural, so I don't think any of them carry that, but no, it was never something that I thought of.  our diamond partners, many of the stores that we work with have reached out and were extremely happy as to that press release that was sent out and our new change in policy. They were very happy that I was so proud of the diamond industry and that I had such a strong position on it. The stores that noticed that we're stopping to do business with them, some have gave pushback, some understood, and we're pretty much almost done  there are there is a case or two where they're also weren't so sure that they're going to keep it in there keep that category in their store so talks there are continuing as anyone change any of your retailers change their policies because of your policy there's one or two cases where they're not sure they want to keep that category i don't know if it has to do with the way that i change my policy i just think that  looking at how much they're selling, okay, product is, you know, flying off the shelves, but how much dollars is it at the end of the day into their pocket? And then how many companies, maybe you said there's a way, and I missed it. How many companies have you ceased to offer this program to because of this new policy? It's less than 10. Right. Josh, I also want to say that I predict in the next maybe year to two years, GIA to also reverse course and not certify those items.  If someone were to submit a lab-grown diamond, they may give you, you know, just like electronic receipt saying, no, this is a lab-grown diamond, but without a grade. Because I don't see that at the price that they charge for their certificates. And at the price where the lab-grown is today, I don't see that being sustainable. And at the same time, them grading more lab-grown, even though I hear that they're grading the lab-grown diamonds with AI,  It's not always with a gemologist. I feel like it's getting in their way of the natural diamonds if you look at their return time for grading natural diamonds grading gemstones today, it's taking a little longer time and you know if I was on the board of GIA or had any Way to influence I would tell them, you know focus on grading your gemstones better more efficiently and You know let go of the lab world. There is no future  Very interesting. You're saying, if I understood you correctly, that the volume of lab-grown that's going to the GIA is meaning that it's taking longer to get the natural stones back because of the total extra volumes. Yes, I definitely feel that way. How much is typically in New York, for example, how long does it now take to get a stone back? For a white diamond, it takes about 10 days. I'm talking about two to four carat stones. Now it's taking about 10 days, where it used to take about four to five days to get it back. And you think that's because of the extra, interesting.  the GIA acknowledge this to clients? Do this as a reason? GIA would never acknowledge such a thing like that to clients. They don't give you a reason as to why things are taking so long. Do you know if your policy was picked up at all by consumers? I mean, has had any reaction there? From the consumer level? I don't think so. It's not something that I would know right away if a consumer has picked up this policy that we've implemented. And what about the lab growing sector? I don't know what connections you have there, but how have suppliers of lab growing reacted to what you did? I have zero connection to the lab growing world.  So I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Where do you see the market going in the rest of the year? We're now in early September. So things are starting to pick up now before the holidays. There has been a very slow summer. What are your expectations for the holiday season? Look, the last year has definitely been a little bit more challenging, but our numbers are still there, if not higher. We're seeing that higher end jewelry, jewelry with detail, things different than what our competitors have to offer.  selling very well. Gems are selling very well. Especially sapphires. I think there's a lot of appetite in the market, but you have to entice people. If you're just going to keep on offering the same thing that the next guy is, there's only so many regular tennis bracelets you can sell, but you got to offer them something new. Entice them in a way, like, oh, you know what? I want to go after this. There always has to be like the next level where the consumer is trying to attain the next level of jewelry  for their wardrobe. So I think if we would put more work into marketing, you put more work into educating the salespeople in the retail stores, I think you could germ up more business and the money's there. The economy's doing fairly well. There's a lot of new money in the world. You just gotta give people a reason to spend it. I think we've been doing a good job with our relationships with retailers, the relationships that we have at the salespeople at those retailers,  them new product, giving them the marketing assets that they could use, explaining why a piece is priced in a certain way, explaining the uniqueness of a certain stone or a certain piece of jewelry. And that has helped. That's what we continue to do.  to restock. I know you're selling finished jewelry, not loose mostly, but what have you seen there? To what extent are retailers restocking at the moment? They're definitely restocking less. There's a little bit of uncertainty. Our price is going to continue to drop. We've reached the bottom yet. People are waiting now for the fall time. This is really the time where people really stock up so they're ready for the holiday season. But the ones that are very well established, that are liquid, are replacing as fast as they are selling. Because we  The last thing you want is for a customer to walk in and you don't have the product. Okay, so the outlook for the holidays is not as bad as I'm hearing. For me, I think it's going to be more than okay. I'm very bullish. I think the holiday market will be okay. Okay. Finally, this is a question I've been asking a few guests with mixed success. Can you describe a typical day in your working life? My typical day is I get into the office around eight o'clock in the morning. And the first thing I do is I catch up on any emails that I receive  prior to that. I follow up with any pieces of jewelry that are in production, finding out at what stage they're in. I usually have three to four days a week, I have a list of stones that I have to purchase based on orders or based on replenishing merchandise. So I go after, you know, purchasing those. And then by the time 10 or 1030 arrives, that's when I start reaching out to my clients and receiving many  phone calls throughout the day for price quotes, for status updates, just usual business. I will go to our factory once or twice a day to make sure everything's going well. I may go to have lunch with a friend or two during the week. I sit with my dad at least once a day for a good 30, 40 minutes and give him all the update that's necessary. And then I finalize my day at around five, six o'clock every day.  any clients outside the US? Yeah, we have quite a few clients outside the US. So how does that impact your schedule? And I'm talking about different time zones. Do you have to work early, start early, work late, ever? So the international business that I do, it's all done early morning, sometimes even right when I wake up. While I'm still home, I'm doing that business. And a lot of it is through email. Right. Just before we finish, do you think going back to your approach on synthetic, do you think other companies are going to do something similar to what you did? I think if they don't do it as verbally as I did, I think they will  do it more quietly, but for sure. Right. Joshua Razzie, it's been really great to have you on this podcast. I've been pleased to hear about your strategy and very grateful for your time and your involvement in this. Thank you, Joshua. Thank you for having me. Thank you.  to get future episodes.
