 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Joshua Friedman.  brand and supplier to retailers. I met Jeff at the luxury show in Las Vegas a month ago and could tell he'd be a great podcast guest. I hope you agree. We spoke about Henry Dalsey's Antwerp roots, the changes going on in the diamond industry and how the Vegas shows went. Jeff also revealed what happened when thieves broke into his premises last year. Enjoy the episode.  off for inviting me to be a part of this. It's very exciting. Me, myself, and the entire office, we are big fans and we listen to all the podcasts. So yeah, so Henry Dowsie, we are a luxury diamond brand. We specialize in engagement rings, wedding bands, anniversary bands. Everything we do is with a live center. We focus on our Henry Dowsie cushion. We call it the Dowsie cushion, which is something we've been doing for about 24 years. I'm third generation owner of Henry Dowsie. So typically I'm the one who runs everything into  the ground. So far, so good. So it really starts in Antwerp. My grandfather is Henry. Pretty much everybody in Henry's side of the family was always in the diamond business. Even me as a kid growing up, like all my uncles were in the diamond business, pretty much everybody in the family. Henry started cutting diamonds at a very early age. He learned it from his father. So obviously he was a really great diamond cutter. But in our history, we've always been cutting diamonds for other people and things like that. We never really had our own company. And so if I sort of take the words that he used to explain it to be my  And that, you know, he was the first to cut the heart shaped diamond, like the real great heart shape before they would cut heart shapes. But a lot of times those grooves would look like U shaped canyons, not really like the perfect V. And the way he kind of simply explained it is that he stuck to polishing this together, turned it into a point and started making grooves. You know, it all sounds very simple, but back then it was revolutionary technology. So he was the first to cut the heart shape like the perfect heart shape. And that really took everything by storm. You know, it was obviously diamonds are a symbol of love.  into a heart shape. So really that's what started him out. And it really started with a couple of diamond cutters in his garage and it turned into, you know, a big business. They were site holders for a long time. Obviously when they were site holders, they cut a lot of fancies, marquises, heart shapes, pears, ovals, emeralds, old, the traditional shapes, fancies especially. But there was always that, you know, need to do something unique and set us apart. So using that technology that he invented, he created all these unique shapes and you still see them today. I think people have done a great job. And of  diamond technology and cutting technology has improved dramatically. So while before we were cutting these things by hand, you know, you would have a butterfly, but it didn't always look like a healthy butterfly. Well today, you know, they're using lasers and everything to cut these things. And it's very, very beautifully unique. But that's really where the history came from. With the heart shape set us apart. We did all these unique shapes. Obviously this is a podcast, so we can't show any pictures, but definitely the images really speak for themselves. So I'll definitely send you some. So if anyone wants to see them, they could take a look at that. But yeah, that's really  What connection to Antwerp does the company maintain?  How has having these special cups, how has that supported the business?  I'm not exactly sure who needs a diamond pineapple, but if there's someone out there who loves pineapples, we cut one for you. At the end of the day, all these things really, you know, just added up to the end result. And the end result is our dowsy cushion. Having this unique rough, cutting these unique shapes. It is a niche. So to really do, you know, huge turnovers and revenue in such a unique niche is very, very tough. So eventually, you know, we added to that. So we started cutting these really unique matched pairs. That became like a huge business for us.  us like bullets, kites, shields, trapezoids and half moons. And especially back then, like three stone rings were everything. So even way before I came into the business, the Hong Kong shows were always very, very big for us. And, you know, people would go buy a lot of big diamonds and then come to us and buy, you know, the unique matching sides. We would also, of course, focus on those unique shapes. It was really an Asian market also, you know, like it'd be the year of the dragon and we would have a diamond dragon, for example, which is, you know, of course, really, really cool. But, you know, we do business as Henry Dowsie and that is the name of our designer brand.  What a day in the life of Jeff Lutz.  unique time zone. Hong Kong is 12 hours ahead of us. Mumbai is 9 hours and 30 minutes ahead of us. So a lot of the work that I do with the overseas factories all gets done first thing in the morning. Even my Israeli friends and everything, they know that I'm up early. So a lot of them will be reaching out to me early before other people in America. And yeah, I definitely like routine. I wake up every day, same time. By 7 o'clock, I've already done a tremendous amount of things. So it really depends on the situation. I'm usually in charge of the puppies in the mornings. Then I drive my son to school in the morning.  we go for a coffee. That is really like the best start of the day. I feel is like that 10 minutes of quality time with my son just hanging out. So if that happens and the routine goes good, then I know the rest of my day is usually pretty good. I usually get to the office around nine, nine thirty. And again, I'm a morning person. So everything which involves a lot of thinking and all those other things, I try and really knock out by twelve one o'clock. Then, you know, the rest of the day, it really gives me a chance to go over any shipments from the factories. Definitely a lot of things come up. We work closely as a team. We have a great team.  I love everybody that works for our company. Everybody's really good at what they do. So we definitely work together a lot. And I also like to use different people in different areas. My sales personnel involve them in production and marketing and vice versa so that everybody really gets like a really good understanding of what it is that we do. I definitely want to make sure that it doesn't matter which customer calls, whatever happens, whoever picks up the phone, knows the customer and is ready to answer all questions. And you know, a big thing, I'm sure we'll touch on that in a minute, but you know, we just came out of Vegas, so there's a lot of follow up we're working on.  Displays, for example, that fit our current selection better than maybe previously. Listen, diamonds are forever and that's a good thing, but it can also not be a good thing if they're not pretty, right? So definitely a lot of things we do after Vegas is reviewing the inventory, seeing what we still have. Sometimes we'll find pieces which we need to recut and things like that. So we met at the luxury show in Vegas. We're recording this on the 25th of June. So it was just under a month ago with the shows. How was that show for you? So definitely liked hanging out with you in Vegas.  like I was getting like in a live diamond market report. So that was definitely fun. I love luxury. I'm also very loyal to luxury. I feel like we've achieved great things at luxury. This is our 14th year and this is my 21st year going to Vegas. You know, the business has changed a lot over the years. I think it's been the greatest way to show Henry Dowsie to the best retailers. Seren Bachman and the whole luxury team. I think they do a really, really good job. Wouldn't want to trade places with them. I think making diamond dealers and jewelry people happy is one of, I think it might be impossible.  actually. They're natural born complainers. But if you're looking to showcase something to the best retailers in the country, I really can't think of a better location or a better show. So we were definitely loyal. You know, it's I already have plans for what I want to show next year. And that's kind of how I keep my goal. It's like, hey, buy Vegas next year. I want to be in this position. Now, was this Vegas booming? You know, I think we need to be realistic and also say that it was a tougher show. I think out of the whole category of jewelry, I think luxury was definitely one of the better  areas. But you know, it's also maybe this year was less transactions and more communications, but it's definitely a great way to meet with your customers, talk to them. So it's just a great way to see everybody again.  the US market and particularly the US consumer market.  that a lot of people were buying a lot of loose, paying great prices. But then in reality, a lot of these stores also sold lab the last two years. So a lot of people built up large inventories of expensive polished and then sold lab. It's just basically some patients. We need to have people sell a little bit so they can buy a little bit more. That said, though, when I speak to loose diamond dealers in New York, for example, they actually seem fairly happy at the moment. They seem to be making decent sales. The Indians are very concerned at the moment, but the New York dealers seem to be doing okay.  Dealers and manufacturers are literally the polar opposite. You know, manufacturers, they buy rough, they need to cut it, they need to move it, they need to sell it and then buy more rough. Dealers, they're like collectors, you know, in a lot of ways we're the same way. If you have a beautiful stone, it's going to end up selling. It's a matter of time and patience. Definitely like we feel what the New York diamond dealers feel. And it's kind of weird because it's almost like, you know, it seems to pick up and it's like, oh, great. Things are back to normal. And then literally the next week things fall off a cliff again.  seems to really be sporadic. And it also depends on the area, to be honest with you. In some areas, things are going better than in other areas. There's also different types of stores. There's the larger independents who might have a store in the same place for over a hundred years and loyal clientele, and they might get less affected by these situations than a bridal store with 20 locations trying to sell one character.  of a return to some of the categories that were under pressure last year? 100%. I think lab grown has had a huge impact. Definitely a much larger impact than I could have predicted a couple of years ago. I do also feel like it's something like I'm kind of tired of talking about it, you know, because it started years ago in our booth. And you know, in the beginning, lab grown was expensive, was kind of cool. It's like, hey, look, we can make this in a lab, you know, we got scientists, you know, I thought like, wow, this is quite cool. And if a natural diamond was selling the wholesale market, let's say for, you know,  20, 30 back, then Lab was selling for 60 back or something. So it wasn't where it was so inexpensive or so. It was just different. But then of course, as time went by, Lab has gotten so cheap. I mean, realistically, if you're a retailer and you need to have a revenue of like, let's say over $10 million, how do you do that in Lab? Especially these days, the price has really dropped. And you can definitely tell like people are just, when it made sense, they wrote the wave, feel like the wave is kind of dead. Prices are too cheap. It's not fun anymore. It's not cool.  People selling it are kind of pretending not to sell it. I noticed that with a lot of our retailers. They'd be like, no, we don't sell lab unless someone asks for it. And then we have other retailers who just from the beginning were like, hey, laboratory diamonds are synthetic. We represent the best, biggest brands in the world to protect the leaps and the Rolex and the Germans. And we don't want to mix that. I feel like those people have really done the best. People come in, you're looking for a lab stone. Oh, the synthetics are available at Walmart. Right. Have you touched lab grown at all? Have you had any involvement? No, from the beginning it was, you know, I'm not as  a scientist and I don't have a laboratory, you know, and there's something beautiful about diamonds. It gets made like by mother nature. It takes billions of years to develop. It's something amazing. I remember when I got engaged, I was very excited about it, you know, and I saved and like this diamond, it meant a lot. And, you know, you're giving something to someone who you really care about and you want to give something value is not the only thing. It's more like the emotions behind it and everything else. And especially like, you know, the American market for a lot of people, their big investments for a long time was a house, a car, and an engagement ring.  And I love the beauty of that. I think when lab was more expensive or something, it made more sense. But now it's sort of like, you know, do you really want to give your fiance a hundred and fifty dollar diamond? You know, it just doesn't seem very romantic on that topic. How central is the bridal market engagement market to the diamond industry these days? I think it's huge. I think it's huge. It's always been huge and it will remain huge. Definitely. Listen, all jewelry stores have a bridal department. It might not be their main focus for some stores. You know, some stores only focus on bridal. It's definitely  the culture over here. I've done 101 million trunk shows, for example. You know, standing in the stores, meeting the people, getting engaged. And, you know, it's just part of the tradition and it's really a beautiful thing. One of my favorite quotes from Warren Buffett is, don't know jewelry, know the jeweler. And that makes a lot of sense to me. I'm in the diamond business. I understand diamonds. Diamonds are literally the only thing I understand. So if I go into another area, I will look at advice from people and I will listen to them and I might be guided by them, for example.  I mean, I love that video you made of visiting the jewelry stores in Las Vegas as a secret shopper. I'm sure they had no idea. By the way, like how annoying must it be for jewelry stores that Vegas week? Like every jewelry person is in town coming to your store. But really what I wanted to say is that like that salesperson is like an influential person. People walk into a store and you know, they might have a budget in mind. They might have some styles in mind. They might have some ideas, but really that interaction with that salesperson and what that salesperson  person does is going to guide them towards what they're actually going to buy. And I think lab is, you know, we don't know the effects of lab yet. If Joshua went to a store and bought a three carat lab grown three years ago, and now Joshua's going to the same store and you're like, Hey, why is it now 10%? It's just not a good feeling. And it kind of reminds me of EGL Israel. EGL Israel was a fake cert. And we, all the jewelry, all the diamond people jumped on  And in the end, if anything, it just hurt them financially. And I feel like this might be something similar. People are aware of lab diamonds. It's all out there. But, you know, I've seen many times where someone walks into a store and it's like, Hey, I'm looking to get engaged. My budget's 5,000. You know what I mean? And then they're like, Oh, have you considered lab? And they're literally like, what is lab? I've never even heard of it. And that's where I feel like, Hey, you know what? We got to keep people's best interest in mind at the end of the day. You know, it's a good karma initiative. And I feel like people doing good, good goes back to them.  And let's see what happens in the long term. Obviously, lab grown is not going away, but I do agree that it might be more towards a fashion area. Women's self purchases. Hey, you know what? I want to buy myself a nice necklace. Things like that. Definitely. Again, like I said, bridal is emotional, you know, and I think a lot of people out there don't even realize what they have on their finger and they're probably going to find out the hard way. Do you sell exclusively to retailers? Yes, we sell exclusively to retailers. I feel like you need to know what you're good at and recognize what others  other people are good at. I'm obsessed with our retailers. I think they do an amazing job and I love working with them and a lot of them are great families. You know, working with all these jewelry stores, Henry Dowsie has always had an opportunity to be involved in things. So originally when we left the city in the beginning of the pandemic, I also wanted to, you know, find a way to be a part of this community over here. So we sponsored the educational foundation and some other things and we thought, hey, you know what? We have this beautiful space. Let's build a showroom and the showroom, you know, we called it the boutique, but it's really more for our customers when they come. It's not really selling to the public.  because we are in all these places and people are seeing our name, people are coming up to the boutique. And to be honest with you, all it was was basically a distraction. We're very busy selling to all of our stores and all these things. And we're not retailers or not pretending to be. The last thing I wanted to do was take away sales from local jewelry stores around here. That is really what I felt started to happen. It's like, hey, I saw this at the store over here. What do you have? And that is just not Henry Dowsie's mission. That is not what we do. And then, of course, opening ourselves up  the public. We did have a break in. We kind of kept it quiet because I didn't feel like it was necessarily the publicity we needed, but we were targeted by a gang. You know, they came in in the middle of the night, eight people. It was very targeted. They knew exactly where they were going. It was, I'm telling you, Joshua, like a movie. It was straight out of like a Netflix series or something. It's like they crossed the road, went through a forest, went up to the roof, you know, office next door, through the window, through the walls, straight into our vault room. They know exactly what they were doing. The only thing I  didn't think they realized is that, you know, we were kind of prepared. So in the end, you know, really nothing happened. They weren't able to get into the safes or anything. But then in the last five minutes, when they realized that they couldn't get into the safes, they went into our boutique and smashed it all up. And we really didn't keep anything in there. The only thing that I was a little upset about was we had this one little area where we have these unique diamonds set up that my granddad caught like a little moon with a little face and beautiful, like unusual things. And straight away I was like, well, that's something I won't be able to replace, you know? And then what was crazy  is that night me, my son, my daughter, my wife, we were literally digging through the glass and we found all of them. And you definitely noticed, you know, if you turn on the news, like a lot of these things are going on everywhere. Of course, you don't expect these things to happen to you. And it could have been a lot worse at the end of the day. You know, we didn't really lose anything. Now, I always joke about this, but it's not really a joke. Like I love the diamond business, right? It's like no heavy lifting, not a lot of cleaning. But unfortunately, this whole this whole thing resulted in a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of cleaning. So that was not a lot of fun. That's quite a story.  What can you tell me about how the wholesale market, or at least the market of selling diamonds and diamond jewelry to retailers has changed in recent years?  and all these other things. The diamond business has just become a much smaller world. Everybody knows everyone. There's no secret mines, no secret customers. So definitely on a dealer point, I think that's had an impact on a lot of the loose diamond dealers. As far as jewelry companies go, Bridal is basically a semi-mount business. You buy the diamond from the store, you buy the semi-mount from the store who then makes it through a designer. When you walk into a jewelry store and you look at the Bridal section, the majority of it is just samples. And that's really what it is.  It's become, you know, you're not picking up gold and diamonds anymore. You're picking up silver and CZs and you're placing an order for it. You know, so this way a lot of jewelry stores have also been open, you know, been able to open multiple locations and fill it with samples. Of course, opening stores and filling it with live merchandise is very expensive. So, you know, the world has become a much smaller place and the way of selling bridal and you know, how all those things have happened has also changed. And I would assume it's going to keep changing. You know, it's like when I talk to my dad, I hear about all the amazing stories of the eighties  the nineties and I'm like, I wish we still lived in those times. And maybe my son will be hearing about how things were amazing in the years, the early twenties, you know, I didn't realize that was so common to place dummy rings in store for how widespread is that? That is the way it works. And how long has that been the case for? It's also going to depend on the jewelry store. I'm really talking about more like the bridal focused chains. You know, if you're an independent, for example, one of my favorite jewelry stores, I'm not going to name any names, but they won't even show a CZ in the store.  because they feel like these CZs look so good that if people see it set up in a ring, they won't want to buy an actual diamond. So these samples, the same thing. Now, as I said before, Henry Dalsey, we do not do any samples or anything. Everything is live diamond rings. So there's definitely been lots of times where I'm standing in a jewelry store and I'm looking at another designer's display and it's just endless amounts of rings and it looks powerful. And then our Henry Dalsey display might have like 10, 15 rings on it and it looks kind of weak, but our display  value is 200,000 while they are just some silver samples. And to what extent do you supply to retailers on memo? So memos always been a big thing. You can have memo done right and memo done wrong. There is nothing more strategic for a jewelry store in owning the right merchandise at the right price. If I look at a lot of successful jewelry stores that I know that has always been their model, yes, they will take memo. But memo is almost like an extra investment. For example, with the jewelry stores that I work with. And again, we have lots of different stores.  lots of different ways of working with people. But people like to buy things and people like to get memo on top of that. And it's really like a combination of both. It's like, hey, you invest into us, we invest into you. But we really monitor our memo really carefully. We make sure that the pricing and everything makes sense. I think a lot of people make mistakes, you know, by putting memo out there at crazy prices. And, you know, that's really a disadvantage to the end consumer, the jewelry store. I've also seen people take a stone on memo, sell it at a high price because they needed to fill that call. And then that same person, maybe a month later, came back  and was like, you know what, I thought I wanted a white diamond, but now I want a fancy yellow diamond, for example. So now that jewelry store has to take back that stone, throw it in their inventory. So I definitely see the advantages of memo and the disadvantages really depending on the stores. We really keep our retailers best interest in mind and we want to be like an asset. We want to put in the work. So all the memo we have out there, we control it ourselves. You know, every two weeks we go over it, we refresh it, we look at it. If it's old and aged, we exchange it. We even keep track of people's asset merchants.  And how is the way that you source diamond?  So sourcing has always been my biggest priority and what I focus on the most because it is a niche, you know, it is rare in nature and sourcing has always been tricky. Of course, for years, Antwerp was always the rough diamond source, but that has changed. And now these diamonds are going all over the world in different parts and sourcing as much as it's what I focus on the most. It's also kind of what I enjoy the most only because it is rare in nature. So when you do stumble across something like spectacular,  It's very exciting, you know, and that's really again I wake up early in the morning and I have communications with everybody overseas and we have people everywhere looking for the rough to cut these diamonds and yes, so in a lot of ways sourcing itself hasn't changed It's maybe the logistics and things like that And how have the sanctions on Russian diamonds affected your sourcing? Have they made it more complicated to procure? Listen, I think you know, especially for a place like Antwerp I think that is basically like a nail in the coffin, but I was reading this morning your article  very nice article, by the way, about some changes that they're going to be making already. And I think it makes sense, but actually getting something done and organizing it where these things make sense and don't do more harm than good really is tough. And at the end of the day, where do these diamonds go? You know, just because they're not coming into Antwerp doesn't mean they're not going in other places. And I think it's going to be very hard. And I love the tracking technology. We're definitely becoming a bigger part of that. You know, you would think, Oh, do people ask about the origins? It rarely happens that people really ask  about the origins of where our diamonds come from. A lot of it oftentimes is like a feeling. You know, it's like that movie Blood Diamonds came out. You know, people think that diamonds from Africa are blood diamonds. And now Russia. And what's actually funny is that we just recently had a situation where someone was concerned about, you know, where the diamond came from, but they were only concerned that it didn't come from Africa. So we were able to trace it. And it's a diamond we mined in Russia in 2018. So, you know, there was no conflicts going on over there. It was actually the World Cup going on in Russia at the time.  of  But it's still sort of sporadic and I definitely think over the next year. That's gonna be a huge thing I think it's also important for the mining companies But of course, you know, it's hard to do right a topic I was just thinking about when I was preparing this podcast and I did share this topic with you one of the interesting things for a brand Like yours is known by the consumers that people also talk about it online So how do you monitor what consumers are saying about your brand online? How do you deal with online reviews with internet forums? So because we don't sell to the public we don't get a lot of direct online reviews  A lot of the reviews we will get are, you know, through one of our retailers where someone might have had a negative experience or it's actually a lot less out there than you think for the amount of volume of rings that we sell. Basically, a negative is your opportunity to turn something into a positive. You know, it's like problem is progress as one of my favorite people likes to say. So, for example, a couple of cases that I can think of off the top of my head, like we had a lady in Dallas, she went to one of our stores, she bought one of our rings. I'm not exactly sure what happened to  the ring, but she left a negative review. Again, very sentimental. My husband just came back from Afghanistan. This ring, it means the world, all these other things. I read this. I thought, hey, you know what? We don't get this a lot. Let's just go way out of our way, you know, and see what we can do here. We worked with the store. We worked with the lady. We got her a different ring, which was pretty much the same exact thing. I guess, you know, people just, if they can tell that you're genuinely invested and you genuinely want to help people, I think it may meant more to her than  actually getting a different ring. We've also had similar situations where people are just a little crazy to be honest with you. And I reached out to the store and I was like, Hey, this lady left a negative review. What can we do? We'll remake the ring. We'll do this. We'll do that. And they were literally like, no, no, no, no, we can't like, she's like impossible. And I think reviews are like that in general. You know, if you're going to look at a restaurant review, people don't go to a good restaurant or like, let me leave them a great review. You know, people go to a good restaurant, have one bad experience and leave a negative review. But definitely I think not too many negative things come up.  How do you actually monitor these? Is it just you searching the internet?  But people can also read through the fakeness sometimes. You'll definitely notice a negative review and then all of a sudden six immensely positive reviews. So I guess it's something people have to deal with. Understand. So you said you live from Vegas to Vegas. Do you have any predictions for the next 11 months between now and the next Vegas show? Wow, you know what? It's kind of hard to predict what's going to happen. Now, I never look at other companies or what they're doing. I really try and focus simply on Henry Dowsie. So I definitely have some goals.  of my goals always involve merchandise. But really you got to look at our 21 year history of Vegas. I guess in a lot of ways, Vegas for me was like a bit of a reality check. You know, we grew up, site holders, fancy houses, factories, and then I came into the business and it's really going to Vegas the first year when I had a bit of a reality check. You know, we had the worst booth in the basement in the worst location with no customers. And that's when I realized like I might have to really work hard and you know, then being able to go upstairs and seeing the beautiful booths  in luxury. I mean, that was really my goal is like, Hey, you know what? I don't know what I need to do, but one day I want to be here. We worked hard and now we have a great thing going on in luxury. And again, it's, you know, I respect luxury very much. So I want to show up prepared. Pre Vegas is as important as Vegas itself. And then post Vegas, we put a tremendous amount of energy into setting ourselves up to win, especially luxury. It's a really an appointment based system. You know, no one really walks by and is like, Oh, Henry Dowsley, I've never heard of you guys, you know, or some  like that or we don't really rely on traffic. I can anticipate the business we're going to do before the show starts. On that topic, I see the show seems to have shifted also more towards, maybe disagree with this, booked appointments rather than traffic. So you feel the companies that plan the client meetings tend to do better than the ones that are just waiting for people to walk in. Again, I don't look at other businesses. I don't know what other people do. I think it's also the nature of what you're selling. We don't really sell one ring at a time, right? So it's a bigger meeting. You need to look through more things. It's first come first serve, right? So  So we have unique pieces. If those unique pieces are sold, then we can't sell you those pieces. So definitely, you know, our booth and I love that kind of like it's always been like the first day it's like a really busy booth. But I want it to be like a good environment for my customers. You know, I want them to come in, have a great time. We really are the easiest going diamond company in the history of companies. You know, there's no pressure. One year they want to buy. Sometimes they don't want to buy. It's hard to explain, but really the goal is for people to walk in and have a positive experience.  like a social club. It's like a lot of the same retailers come at the same time. Now you can tell sort of like, I'll see you next year here in the booth at the same time. And I've also seen in other booths where it's kind of tricky, you know, where there's a lot of competition within the booth. We don't work like that. We really work as a team. We're in it together and we put our customers first and we try and create like a great environment.

Likewise.  you
