 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Avi Kravitz.  facing the diamond industry and of course facing De Beers including traceability and how De Beers is facilitating this through its Tracer blockchain platform, the importance of branding, some observations about Lab Grown and De Beers positioning within that market, the company's ongoing negotiations for a new marketing and mining deal with the Botswana government and Bruce also gives his take on current market conditions. I really appreciated Bruce's openness and candidness in this discussion and gained a lot of insight into how the company's  the trends and developments affecting our industry. So please enjoy my conversation with Bruce Cleaver.  long term since I've been in Tel Aviv, so I'm very excited to be here. Right, you're here for the Israel International Diamond Week, the various conferences and trading events taking place, and you've just given your keynotes addressed to the conference. And there were some interesting themes, I think, that we pulled out of your speech. You went quite hard on Labgroen in terms of the positioning of Labgroen in the market, as well as, of course, everyone's interested in what's happening with the beers in Botswana. And then you also touched on the geopolitical situation and the conflict in New  crane and how that's affecting the diamond market. And I'd like to start there because when I look back at the beer's development and working with the industry, it feels like it's almost been working towards this moment. And you alluded to that in your speech in terms of getting the industry on board with being more transparent and coming to, you know, better reporting standards, things like that. So maybe let's start with how you see the industry developing in that conversation.  and required pivots to transparency and these issues, how it's playing out in today's environment. Sure, Avi. So one of the questions that I was asked today and I touched on is what have I seen in bar wave change in the diamond industry in my time as CEO of De Beers? And one of the things I touched on was transparency, not just in my six and a half years, but in all my 17 years at De Beers. And, you know, the diamond industry has gone in that time from being relatively untransparent, I think, to becoming increasingly accepting of the fact that transparency is the name of the game and the future not  just a done industry is about transparency and all these tools we have now that make transparency such an issue and so immediate for people. So, you know, we, you know, with reference to the current conflict in Ukraine and how De Beers might deal with this, this process started for us a long time ago. We started building industry best practice principles as long ago as 2005. 2008, we introduced pipeline integrity and we started Tracer, which is something I'm very proud of. It's a very, very successful, fully distributed ledger blockchain, which starts at source in 2018.  2017 not because we could possibly see a conflict coming because we obviously couldn't but because we could see that as provenance became more of an issue as Transparency became more of an issue. We would need to be able to tell a story better So, you know, I'm very comfortable with this year goes on we'll be able to put all of the debiers Production to about a certain size on the blockchain and we loading up at least a hundred hundred and twenty thousand diamonds a site now So it's done very well at that level I also said in the interview that as far as I was concerned I've always thought that in due course trace it could be an industry solution  I think some of the things to be as does do tend to work for the whole industry rather than just ourselves But it was important. We got the de Beers goods on first So I'm certainly open to working beyond that point to make it an industry solution And of course as you touched on the kind of geopolitical things going on in Ukraine has made this a much more urgent issue But to me, it's actually just an acceleration of what was a trend that I think you know We have thought a lot about and I think has been coming along in the diamond industry for years and you've been writing what is it? Right just see in terms of trace  And we'll get back to those other trends. But in terms of Tracer, if it's open to the industry, how do retailers leverage Tracer? Because it's fine to get all the goods in the midstream onto the platform, but ultimately it's a tool to show provenance, to enable better storytelling. So how can a retailer, how does the retail sector? That's a great question. I think the ultimate issue here is exactly as you say, is what does this mean for a consumer, for an end consumer, for a customer who buys the diamond in a retail store and why is it meaningful for them? Now we know that something like 30  6% of women and nearly 40% of all Gen Z purchases are already starting to ask this question. That's a big change, I think, two, five years ago. So actually we need to make this work at a retail level for all kinds of reasons. I think step one was to get the system working. Step two is to get the midstream participating because that's a complex value chain and it's important to get all parts of that on it. But I think for us, the next step is how do we work with retailers to enable richer and better storytelling in a way that is seamless, not clunky and so on. And ultimately the dream, of course, is to be able to say,  I can tell you that particular diamond you're busy buying did the following good in the following country and built a school or built a hospital. And so we've already got 60,000 polished diamonds on Tracer. And I think you'll expect to see that more. So I fully agree with you. This is not only a B2B solution. This needs to ultimately be a value cross the value chain solution. And we certainly are going to be working with retailers on that. Right. One thing I've been thinking about again, as I've kind of observed the journey that De Beers has been on and taken the industry on is that initially when the company started  talking about these issues. There was kind of a focus on branding, you know, De Beers introduced Forevermark around the same time in the early 2000s. And we're not sharing that conversation as strongly as we did back then today. It's just, it's all about, you know, just prove your provenance and let's, let's chase those diamonds. But for me, it seems very strongly to be a branding play. And so firstly, why aren't we hearing more about branding in this context of the market environment?  that we're experiencing because surely that's where the opportunity lies. Yeah, I agree with that and I've said consistently and we see big opportunities in brands and so there's no less focus on that. I suppose the real issue though is given the urgency of what's been going on in Ukraine, the urgency has been on making sure the system works and making sure the tech works, which I'm very comfortable now and working with all kinds of industry players now in order to get as many people as we can on it. But I totally agree with you and we haven't lost focus on this point. I mean, ultimately there is a brand premium here for brands who do  this correctly and obviously we are a brand as De Beers and we think a lot about that. So I'm glad you raised it. I don't want people to think we're less focused on the brands. I just think there's only so much you can do in a day and we've had to deal with the really urgency of the last probably year. And we've made amazing progress and the tech with Tracer and onboarding the midstream is not going to stop there. So how does the De Beers brand is tapping into Tracer's technology in order to enable the story that De Beers and Forevermark is able to tell? So there are various pieces of work underway already about how do we  we tell that story better connected to the brand, connected to Forevermark, Code of Origin is something we've spoken about, and all these things are gonna coalesce around Tracer, which is really just the platform that will give you the building blocks to deliver the brands. So I'm glad you raised it. I mean, these are fundamental parts of our future. But then looking at the industry as a whole, back in the 2008s, let's say, the idea put forth was that the industry is gonna see more branding. I wonder if that has transpired to that same extent, and is that where the industry is moving?  is the watch industry that you see very few unbranded watches. And so do you still see that same part that the diamond industry is developing? Yeah, I think we do. And I think one of the things that has characterized the last 10 years has been brands. I think we have no doubt that brands sell at a premium to generic. And whether that's the designs, whether that's the whole story that the brands tell, or whether it's a combination of those, we would expect that to continue. And the research tells us all along that not just in the diamond world, people will pay a premium for brands.  the value of the brands, the values of the brands are the same as the values of the purchaser. And like I said, that's why I think Trace is a building block. It's not the nirvana of all of this. It's the platform on which you can start to deliver and prove to people the whole story along the chain and how you build the brand is actually valid, demonstrable and honest. Where does that leave the smaller independence dealer, let's say, in the market? You know, we hear in Israel, it's very much a trading center. And when we speak about provenance on a wider scale in front of an audience of  these independent dealers and I think also at a retail level where you have independent jewelers that maybe don't have that same maybe awareness is the word or just scale or scale or budget frankly to implement these programs how are they going to be affected by this move this quite significant move within the industry that particularly if the new measures the sanctions measures that the G7 is talking about come into play which will require a proof of origin in some form you know how  Yeah, how does the machine get affected? It's a complex question. I guess the first part is more of a kind of a defensive part, which is prove that the goods are where you say they came from. And so that's kind of step one, just to make sure that the goods that we have and all the goods we put on the platform, I guess, in time can make their way through the value chain. And then there's a second question is how do people think about potentially monetizing that a little bit more? Now, obviously, some of our models with things like Forevermark have always been to try and support independents who might be really, really good businesses, but don't really have the scale to build a brand for themselves. So how we evolve that in the context  of Forevermark's journey and the context of using Tracer as an underlying platform I think will be part of that answer. And I mean, I don't know the answer to this question, but my guess is even in trading of goods, there will come a time when provenance goods sell for more than non-provenance goods. Now that's not to say that's the same as branded goods and there is a different debate there. But obviously independent dealers are less involved, I guess, in creation of brands and so on than retailers. And of course, whether I like it or not, investing in a brand is expensive. It doesn't come for nothing.  on building the De Beers brand and all our partners and retailers who do the same do as well. These are not trivial exercises. So I think that's also got to evolve as we go along. But I'd kind of like to think of it as two parts. First part is provenance, which is, I think, step one of being in the game and probably being ahead in the game. And the second part is on top of that, what do the brands do with provenance and their own brand stories and their own designs and their own things that they do to build their own brands. Right. And I think one realisation that the industry is coming to is that you don't have to be a big name brand to be a brand.  has their name to protect. That's quite correct. So we have some tremendously good smaller independent customers who are great businesses and in their towns are tremendous brands. So yeah, you don't have to be in 600 doors to be a brand, but you have to do something different and you have to have your customer trust you. Right. You have to add value. I would like to touch on Labgro. Your discussion this morning was quite extensive and how you see Labgro being positioned in the market at the moment. We know that there's been  a decline in value of lab-grown supply as supply has gone up and technology has improved and the cost has come down. And so the value proposition of lab-grown has declined. De Beers famously launched its Lightbox brand, a lab-grown brand, with an $800 per carat price point. And that was controversial on, I think, particularly in the lab-grown market because they didn't want to limit their pricing to a set price and they  kept the natural diamond industry model. Now that we've seen this devaluation of Labgroon, how does Lightbox pricing fit into that? Is Labgroon, is Lightbox almost overvalued now as an $800 per carat price point? Yeah, that's a great question. Look, I think, I mean, as you know, the key for me here has always been priced and we have always felt as an organization that a Labgroon is a perfectly legitimate category, as you know, and we participate in it. But it's all about price because it's a fashion piece and not a luxury piece.  That's why a two-carat should cost double over a one-carat cost because it costs you twice as long to grow it in a reactor. Not the differentials you get in natural diamond pricing of a one-to-a-two-carat, which is a rarity-driven thing. I think the evidence is starting to show that that thesis is correct. I spoke earlier today about, for example, you see some retailers saying, I'll give you a two-carat lab grant for free if you buy a two-carat natural. You wouldn't have seen that two or three years ago. I think the trend for prices to come down as production goes up will continue. As production goes up, of course, cost of production goes down,  of these producers are volume businesses, so the more volume you produce, the more cost you can take out. Now, not all lab-grown diamonds are equal, as we know, and there are better quality and less good qualities, and there's HPHTs and there's CVDs and so on. And we've always been at the end in Lightbox in producing the best quality CVD, but at prices that we think are prices where consumers will see this as fashion and not luxury. You know, when you ask me the question is, have we dropped lab-grown prices at Lightbox? In a sense, of course, we have, because we launched this in 2018, that's six years ago, and inflation has been called it 25%  30% since then and we haven't increased price at all. So in some senses, you know, when people ask this question, I think if you look at the real price of a light box one character today compared to when we launched it actually has come down in real terms because inflation has been so I think the equivalent price is probably $700 already. As to whether we will keep reducing price, I mean, we do want to make a margin in this business. We do work very hard on cost and as and when we are able to bring costs down, we will certainly look at our pricing for sure. But you know, we started miles below other people. Most of them are still above us. Some have come below us.  but I do stress not all production processes are the same. So ours is very good, very well done, all carbon neutral, I think that in America, where some of the input costs are probably a bit higher than some other people. But for me and the team, it's always about keeping costs down and that's consistent with an industrial business. If you look at the other side of element six, which is not so much for your viewers, but the industrial side of it, that's also a business where cost is in people's mind every minute of every day. So these are the kind of businesses where you are looking at cutting costs all the time. Right. I think maybe the mistake that we as outside of the WBIA's discussion  would have made is that $800 per carat price points was a message to the rest of the lab grown industry to adopt that price point. It seems to me that Lightbox is being kind of positioned also as a brand. And so there is a premium in that price point. Yeah, I agree with that. I don't think there's any reason why Labgrown will be any different than any other fashion product. There'll be brands that sell for more and there'll be brands that sell for less, but they will sell within the band of a category. So Lightbox is a brand and it's already been quite a successful brand. It obviously gets a lot more talk than the size of the business. That's probably good for  for a brand. So there's all that in the mix as well. And then that's going to come down to what you would expect in any fashion. How good are your designs? What's your value proposition to a fashion customer compared to somebody else? So I don't think you're going to see all that going to settle at the same price. I think there will be brands and they'll be generic and they'll be successful ones and so on. But I think the trend that I spoke about continues to be prices, even at retail now, are starting to get to prices where it's difficult for a consumer to say it's the same. We're not there yet, but there's some evidence that that decline continues.  again and I do want to touch on two more topics if you don't mind. And the first being Botswana and there's been a lot of talk about the various negotiations that Beers has engaged with the government of Botswana at the moment. And there are two aspects to that. There's the 10 year sales and marketing agreements that is on the table and then there's also the mining licenses. And that's been spoken about. Everyone's read the news about, you know, various comments by different sides, not so much by the Beers, I will mention, about those negotiations.  But I would like to focus on the mining licenses because that's not really talked about too much in these discussions First, can you explain to us what those mining license involve? What is the what is on the table in terms of the money? Yeah, I'm glad you asked it because it is worth clarifying this as you know I remain very confident that we will come to a deal that both the government of Botswana who are friends and colleagues not just in depth swan are and but in debits and us are happy with and We've been in business with the Botswana government for more than 15 years  years and we've renegotiated many things along the way. I'm glad that you raised the point because I think it's lost on people sometimes. There are actually two things being negotiated as you say. The sales agreements are more regular and they come up for renewal whenever they expire. But what's also being negotiated this time, and it's the first time I can remember when two are being done at once, which I think might explain why it's been a bit more complicated than prior ones, is the mining licenses. So Depswan are the mining company, which is 50-50 owned by the bears and the government, has four mines, two of which are two of the great mines of the world.  in Oropa. Those mines are mined under a typical license awarded by the Botswana government under the Minerals Act. To any player in the mining business who wants to exploit the mineral needs to get a license. The licenses are statutorily limited to 25 years and the current license expires in 2029. But we are in the process of negotiating renewing it now and not in 2029 and we could actually have left it until 2029 and just done the sales. But we and our partners government felt it was responsible to renew it now. And the reason is there are  expansion projects coming at Botswana and Arapa, which will pay back, in other words, produce diamonds only after the license has expired, which expires at the end of June 2029. But you need to start making investments now. Mining is a long-term business, and to do the next cut at Arapa and to go underground at Xuading, we've got to start spending quite a lot of money now. So we don't particularly want to spend that money when the license expires with no certainty that it will be renewed, and nor does the Botswana government, because we all want the same thing, which is production to continue at Debswan. So we agreed with them we would do  same now, both these two now, including renegotiating the mining license. That's what's going on and I think is why this has taken some time because it's a kind of a one-off. It happens only every 25 years. There's no magic in the 25 years. That's what the mining statute in Botswana requires. So the renewables will be from June 29 until the mid-2040s. And that's, I think, why this is important. And that's one license for all four operations? That's one license for the whole company, Debswana, over all of its mining operations, all four of them.  There's always such a complex structure within De Beers, given the government's ownership of, it's like the government is awarding itself, or half of itself, a license to operate. Yeah, look, I mean, De Beers, as you know, is a business of partnership. So wherever you look in the world, we're in joint ventures with people, with governments and what's more, and then maybe with commercial partners in other places. So I'm kind of used to this. But I think the government does a very sound job here, which is to separate the regulatory side of ticking the various requirements in the mining license together.  a new license against the commercial side, which is really a commercial negotiation between Debswana and the government. Ultimately, it will result in the company Debswana, as we know it now, given a 25 year extension, new license, not an extension, on the terms that we agree. And those are the terms that actually the two shareholders of Debswana agree, which is Debswana and government, but government acting in its capacity as a shareholder, not as a regulator. But the Botswana government, as you know, do this kind of thing well, and the regulations are well adhered to in the processes of the funds. And so once those licenses are in place, then it gives  Anglo-American and the government license to invest in those six million programs. Exactly. So once that's renewed, hopefully by around mid-year, then all of the investments that we need to now start making now to get ready to start going underground, to start doing the next cut, will be able to be done now so that in 29 and 30 and 31 we still continue to get diamond supply. So it's actually just prudent of all of us to do this now. Right. So for example, at Zhuanning, there's talk now of going underground. So that would be the next expansion. Yes, so as a good example, so Zhuanning is currently a mining cut eight and we are doing a lot  of work on the next cut, the next complete cut, which is cut nine, and that will become the major source of ore in a few years' time. So cut nine, the pre-work's been done, the stripping, because you strip the waste from the sides of the pit, so that when you get there deep enough in the pit, you're ready to start mining the ore. The underground, these are big, long, complex projects. It hasn't gone to the board for approval yet, so I can't tell you exactly, but this can take 10 years between the time you agree to start doing it and when you see your first ore. Now, no one wants a production gap, none of us.  So when you start spending that money now, so that when cut nine is finished, the underground is red. Cut nine is not the major source of diamonds yet. So we've still got to do cut nine before. But it does show you how long-term diamond mining is, all mining is, which is obviously very different to people who are traders. But we have to think about spending capital for 10 years before you see your first cent of revenue. I remember when cut eight was decided upon and it was a big deal for, well, firstly, Zhuanning. I don't know how familiar people are with the specifics of these mines, but Zhuanning is such an important  and such an important mine as well. Yeah, Sochua Ning actually is a fantastic place to go. I don't know if you've been there, but it is a very large, very complex mine. I'm very happy to tell you 99.8% of the people there are that's one. The most fantastic and capable people and it's a really, really impressive and slick operation. And the reason we have so much confidence is that we've got a great team there and they will continue to do this work. But what I think people don't know who don't live in the mining world is how long it takes and how much money you've got to spend.  spent before you see your first cent. So I can't tell you the cost of the underground because it hasn't been through the board, but I'll give you an example. In Venetia, where we're going underground, and that's in South Africa, that's in our South African operation, so not part of the Botswana story. We started going underground at Venetia in 2013. We're getting our first ore this year, it's taken 10 years. That is a $2 billion project. So we would have spent the best part of $2 billion before we see one cent of revenue. That is a big undertaking, and that's why mining companies need to be deep pocketed and need to be able to fund them through a cycle.  Very different world to the world that diamond traders and cutters and polishers live in, but you know people should remember there's a lot of effort and money that goes into getting this amazing stuff out of there. And that all is to ensure there's that consistency of supply and continuity. And maybe that's a good segue to the current market conditions and I would like to ask you about the site environment, the supply environment at the moment. You've mentioned in the beer's statements and about your sales that there's been a delay among site holders requiring their goods.  So this year it seems that the market, where usually the first quarter of the year is a busy year and we see larger sites, larger volumes of rough coming to the market that was postponed to later in the year. And so when can we expect that? How is the beer is planning and how siteholders are more importantly planning their supply cycle? When can we expect a larger sites to? You know, my crystal ball is probably no better than yours. And as you know, we don't we don't give out kind of forward information, but I would agree with you. I think  Certainly Site 1 was somewhat atypical in that it was a lower volume than a normal Site 1. And a normal Site 1, if there's such a thing as normal in the world anymore, particularly American retailers start to restock and therefore rough them through the system. I don't think there's any doubt that inflation and things like that had some impact on us. So we didn't, and we could feel this, so we didn't put more volume on the market, but we didn't see a huge amount of restocking. We do see pretty decent solid demand in America. So I'm not sitting here thinking there's a real crisis of demand in America. I think the real key for us for the rest of the year is  China and as soon as China gets back to normality or gets to a point like we saw in America in 2020, I guess when retail stores reopened, I think I'm rather hopeful that we will see quite a strong pull. As you know, even though China is not as big a market as America, it's quite important from a pricing point of view. Historically, when diamond prices have been strong, often the Chinese market has been strong, too many rough prices. So I think it really does depend on where the Chinese market gets to. I think there's quite a lot of hope in China now. The team was there two weeks ago. I wasn't there, but I'll be  to them that certainly Golden Week in May, I think, is a kind of a time when we might hope for some more demand. I think Chinese New Year was not bad, but it wasn't stellar. And I think that's partly because people are starting to travel again and they're starting to shop again. But we haven't yet got back to the levels of the pandemic. So partly it's dependent on that. And yeah, there are pockets of inventory in parts of the market that are probably slightly in overhang and there are pockets that are not. And so you're seeing an interesting market now where sometimes the smalls are felt to be in short supply and some of the bigger goods are not. And we shouldn't forget that  this we see all the time through the cycle all the goods do sell and they don't all sell at the same time. So I would be hopeful that if American demand continues to be stable and inflation starts to come down and Chinese demand picks up, we should be in for a better second half. I spoke today about uncertainty in the world and how these things happen that you can't predict. I didn't mention the banking crisis again, of course, and that of course is another risk out there. So assuming that all plays out normally and assuming stability returns in the banking industry generally, because that's good for us.  confidence, I would be hopeful that towards May golden week in the second half of the year we have a more epic. It feels like there's this sort of rebalancing of the market, you know, that's been going on from COVID that we're still kind of going through those ebbs and flows of finding our place in the market. I think that's a fair comment and I think, you know, we have short memories in the diamond industry. 2020 was the end of the world for all of us and 2021 was so good we all expected things to continue to grow off that base, but 2021 is probably not a repeatable year. So I think you're right, I think we're settling into  What is a new normal? But you know, the third site's just started. I don't have any reports on it from the team. But the second site, we sold a fair amount of volume actually, and sold it at prices that seem to be taken reasonably well by the market. So, you know, we'll continue to do what we do. We'll be driven by demand. We will look to sell into pockets of demand. And even in those numbers that you see in sites one and two, there are some areas of quite strong demand and some areas of less demand, which is normal in the department. Well, Bruce, thank you so much for your time and your candidness and your openness to speak to us.  appreciated. Thanks Avi, it's always nice talking to you. And we'll keep a close watch on all of our journeys as the beers continues to lead the market in many areas. So thank you for everything. Thank you. It's a great pleasure. Nice to be here.
