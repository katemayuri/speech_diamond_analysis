 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Javi Kravitz.  impact of sanctions on Russian diamonds will have on the wider market and of course an important message relating to lab-grown diamonds. The presentation created a buzz in the exchange at the time and I'm confident you'll gain a lot from this podcast recording.  I'm very ironic. Thank you, boss. Sometimes people, you know, thank you very much. We really appreciate it. And I really want to thank the Rappaport team. I also want to mention one of my first mentors, Mucky Scheinfeldt, who passed away this year. He taught me to cleave diamonds in Antwerp in 1974, 75. And his brother, Michel, you know, it's been a long time, not the time, he's here. He's a Belgian and Yumi is here of the Scheinfeldt family. I also want to mention someone very important,  was in Belgium and that was five or doubles was a Tremendous diameter you can't imagine what an old but a real diameter wasn't those days You know I so Schnitzer here today I saw a son and I think of taking this to schnitzel when I came to Israel You know he had thrown me out of the bushes in the time And he said you really gonna come to Israel rabbit, but I'll help you every way And he really did so there are certain figures that I look up to and you know one of them was five or double to I wrote an article called  trust. You can find it on the internet. And he wouldn't sell diamonds to people if he thought the people wouldn't make money for him. That's the kind of person he was. Really amazing. So I want to mention those mentors. I got here today with the help of many other people. I want to mention our team. Miley's been with me 27 years from Israel. Amazing guys. Shua is here 20 years. Sabal is here. Shimon, these are, these are, but that's just like the tip of the iceberg. We have some really great people working for us here in Israel. I really  on the world. So you look at me, blab, blab, I'm the big talker, but there is behind me a lot of wonderful people who do great work. We established in 78, 150 employees about seven countries. We're in Jerusalem, we're also in Dubai, and this is from, I think 2002, shit, Robin invited me out there. In any case, 20,000 clients. We don't own diamonds. We train every dollar in diamonds, we try to make money without diamonds. It's like, you know, who invented sushi? You know invented sushi? They say two Jews who wanted to have  restaurant without a kitchen. That's our method. So here I am in the diamond business and what am I? I'm just a guy who doesn't have much. So adding value services. Rapnet is a very important part of what we do. Largest trading network. We list goods about $9 billion every single day, 1.7 million diamonds, 500 carat thousand carats of recycled. I'm happy to say that we are constantly bringing goods to Israel from the United States and I think today we have 2,400 and something. We're into certification  checking things and we're looking at source certification. But the real thing about us is I should say the values. And the value stuff, I gotta tell you, we've been in business now 45 years. The one thing that has sustained me is my wife, of course. Behind every successful man is a woman telling him he's wrong and she's right. But the values is the thing that has sustained us, which is ethical, transparent, competitive. You bring transparency and competition  You create fair market value and you piss everyone off and efficient markets. So those are our values that we live by really since 1970 So enough about me. Let's talk about what's really going on if I think about the diamond distribution How do we get our diamonds? How we know we make money at diamonds? You could buy stuff in Africa for $150 a carrot and then you can sort it sort it and sort it and select it and this woman in Rodeo Drive, California What's a two-carat fair shake that VS to?  and it's worth a whole bunch more money. So our ability to segment out and select out what we're selling, what we're doing, to get the right person, the right price, the right goods, you'll see that's the key. So this distribution, I thought, where are the problems? Okay, synthetic diamonds, I'm going to talk about Russian sanctions, big issue, but it's all about distribution. Where do your diamonds come from? Answer the question and you will deal with these issues. But it's not enough to talk about it, you got to say, what are you going to do about it?  What are we going to do about this? And that's really important question. First of all, synthetic diamonds. Look, people make money. What are you going to do? Shoot them? Wait, I'm making money. A guy walks in this store and wants to buy synthetic diamonds. I should sell them? Well, depends. Short term versus long term. If someone brought you a diamond, a stolen diamond, you know, do not say, hey, do you listen, New York, stolen diamonds, would you buy them? You can make money.  Blood diamonds. Short-term profits versus long-term. Question. What do I do? I don't know what to do. Russian sanctions. We are seeing the world splitting apart. We talked today about this bifurcation of markets, bifurcation of synthetic from natural. Don't worry about synthetics, it's bullshit. But leave that alone, I'll talk about that. But what about the bifurcation of the natural market? What about the goods that are coming from Dubai?  Do you know who owns those companies? So what are we talking about here when we think about this diamond market that we're in? How are we going to deal with, what are we dealing with when our customers ask, even if our customers don't ask? So that's a big issue with these Russian sanctions we'll talk about. Mixers are making money while destroying diamond industry integrity. Who can you trust? What can you verify? Now this business, this bourse, so happy to remember this bourse,  New York was, remember all the Bushes, but the Bush was all about having people you can trust. That is the essence of our business, that is the essence of our organizations. So who can you trust? How can you verify? President Reagan. Trust and verification. And his declarative statement, I am telling you that it's okay. Is that enough in today's diamond world? And where are we going with this? The industry is breaking apart in two.  יציאק בצריים  the watch industry. Does anybody here have a watch without a name on it? Anybody? Is there any one generic watch here anywhere? But we brand things and we don't only brand things, but we also brand people. If you think the diamond business is about sorting diamonds, not so much anymore. It's about sorting people. Who are you dealing with? Actually it was that way all the time. And also this whole idea of curation. Are you trying to sell steak to vegetarians? Is that where your money is going?  Is that where your marketing is going? Do you understand your customer? Have you looked at your customers website? Do you know if he has landing pages? Is he registering the clients? How deep do you go in this business relating to people? Because in the end we're a people business. And then this whole question about source certification is coming up very strong. So let's rock and roll.  איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה איזה  the  Rolex is not so fancy. Patek Philippe, watch. Wear it for a day. See how it makes you feel. But my point is something is the value of having value. And we're marketing, promoting, selling synthetics as a replacement. Sell synthetics all your life. I don't care. Replacement. I have this, I have that, they're exactly the same. But they're not exactly the same. But that's how we sell it. Synthetic diamonds are not the equivalent of natural diamonds.  because they do not store value and are being produced in limited quantities. What was Bruce's say, 70,000? Come on, there are guys in China producing 2,000 tons of grit, which is abrasives, which they're now converting to produce synthetic milling. And a lot of the better bitter goods, they're all VBSs, it doesn't matter if the quality. So there's no differentiation. My big point is that unlimited quantities  stuff is showing. Now, many if not most of our trade are operating dishonest and unethically. So they have stupid articles for us. Rabbetworth says that synthetic diamonds are just... No, synthetic diamonds are fine. Tell the whole truth. If you're going to compare it to a natural diamond, fine. But don't say they're exactly the same if the natural diamond is scarce in all its value and if the synthetic diamond doesn't. Tell the whole truth, not half truths. It's full disclosure.  Synthetics will not replace natural diamonds. It's not the same thing. It's not the same business. It's like, uh... I don't want to be disgusted. Yeah, screw it. Prostitution will not replace marriage. Try that one on. Okay? There's different values that are in place over here. Okay? Consumers are overpaying. It won't be long now. You're all worried about synthetics. Don't worry. It's blowing away in the wind, and I'll show you why. Even for my good friend here.  So here we have a story from Edon and all I can say is, hey, I don't understand so much, but what the hell is going on? The prices is like poop from a goose. You're going from $1,800 to what is this, 450 or $500? And this is only the beginning. There's going to be so much of this stuff. It's going to make glass look expensive. I don't mean glass, Swarovski.  same time profit margins. Now why would that be? If the price at the B2B level is dropping, like proof from a goose, I mean dropping, why are we partying going up? Maybe someone's not telling the truth. Maybe our good friend the consumer, now you can just fool some of the people some of the time, the rest of the people the rest of the time, but I don't think you can fool everybody at once. This is gonna come out. People are gonna know this because people are gonna compete.  competition will drive this synthetic market into the ground not even a question and You know it done is fine But the idea that we should somehow worry about synthetics and change the way we do natural bullshit Forget about synthetics. They're going to hell if someone's running off a cliff Our diamond prices doing oh prices came down a bit again and don't thank you for the day I don't want anyone to think that I'm making fun  only data. Okay? So this is 8 hours. So what the hell is going on here? This stuff's dropping what? 70%? This stuff, okay, it went up because the United States government decided to throw $100 bills out of helicopters for a couple of years. But look at that, it went up, it comes down, but it's still up there. So what's going on here? Are you worried about synthetics? Ridiculous. Do you know I have CZ? It's $2.5 a carat. I'll put it up here and I doubt most people can tell the difference. Certainly not when the woman's dancing.  This is going to come out.  This is really last year, but now oh we're elevating we're getting smarter This is the Hong Kong show last two weeks three weeks ago. They don't even compare it They just throw you a number you want to carry $189 and a lot of the stuff that's that bank is usually higher published parities anyhow oh Come on GIA. Please please please such certified CC come on come on Consumers have a right to know if it's flawless or a VBS one or a VST  So this is where we're... So why am I getting so excited about synthetics? Because we ourselves as an industry have lost our confidence. We're having some kind of a stupid identity crisis. We're unnatural, we're real, by the way. Real is illegal and it's late to admit it. You don't use the word real when you're referring to synthetics. So now we're already going away from Rappaport, thank God. We're just throwing numbers. 150, 100. It's a joke. And the whole industry, oh, what are we gonna do?  because we want to make money. It's not even wrong about making money. Short term, long term, reputation, this stuff's about to blow up. Okay. The coming shakeout will be brutal for synthetic sellers. I mean, brutal. Not so much for those selling natural diamonds. They go up, they go down. But the synthetics are a one-way road to hell. They're not gonna go up. No how, no way. Now, synthetic retailers, beware. Consumers will reach  Remember your name? Once they find out the real value of what you sold them. You can always separate them. You can sell some swap land. You know in Israel I can sell you property right opposite the Acaria Hotel. Really good quality. I mean I can sell you land that is right opposite the Acaria Hotel. It's in the ocean. So the point here is do you really think synthetics are a better deal for your customers than naturalists? If you do, go ahead and sell them. And if the only thing you're selling is price anyways,  The best place to buy diamonds price wise in the United States is who can guess? I don't sell. Where's the best? I don't know what to do with consumers. Guy help me. Where do you think is the best deal in the United States for natural diamonds? Costco! Costco! Costco doesn't need to make money when they sell diamonds because everyone gives a hundred dollars a year membership fees and they have about 200 to 170 million members. There's all kinds of models here. Okay? So Costco's there.  But the point is, is this really a good deal? If you really think so, go ahead. Go off the cliff, take your customer with you. But honestly, ethically, you really think it's a good deal or you just did it for the short term money. That's something that everybody should wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, ask their husband, ask their wife, ask your child. And what are you doing so kosher? We support the FTC concept that consumers are best served with the broadest basket of products and services.  אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם, אורם,  And you don't tell the whole truth you are a disgusting unethical liar. That's how I see it. Tell the whole truth. So what is the truth? This is what I'm asking. The following statement should be required on all marketing material, grading reports, and invoices for man-made diamonds. I use the word man-made. See? How nice is that? Man-made diamonds do not appreciate the value of like natural diamonds because they can be created in unlimited quantities and are not subject to the same supply limitations as natural diamonds.  And say they'll buy them. I just say just put that statement on your invoice put your statement on your certificate Just let the consumer know it was a willy-nilly ways. So why are you afraid to tell they know what he's this kind of a Disclosure is a step beyond saying that it's synthetic because you're telling you what's behind the fact that they are synthetic But that's not all Look at the absolute Ridiculousness the natural diamond industry affects man-made diamonds synthetic  man-made, L.G.D., bullshit, whatever you want to call them, should have the same disclosure and regulatory requirements as natural diamonds. They should have the same treatments, disclosure for man-made diamonds should be the same as for natural diamonds. Air tank money laundering and counterterrorism regulations should be the same. Why is it? If they're exactly the same according to the F.D.C., why are they exactly the same according to the OFAT and FATF and all these other regulatory agencies? System of warranty requirements should be the same.  the same as for natural diamonds. I'm asking for a level playing field, but to be established in fair, fair and transparent market competition. I'm not against competition, it drives business. I'll tell you a story. It's September 2012, I made a conference in New York. I'm the 13th because everyone was afraid to go to New York. I purposely made a conference, and we had General, what's his name there, with the first synthetic diamond labyrinth we're using, HPHT in Tampa, Florida or someplace. And he had made nice fancy colored diamonds,  So this guy goes and he buys two fancy color yellow diamonds for his wife to carry teach And her friend sees and her friend makes her husband miserable until he buys you to carry natural diamonds So what do you think happens the first one sees the second one is natural. She goes back to husband say buy natural give me the real ones and so this idea that there's some kind of a positive symbionic relationship  might exist. I'm not against free markets, FTC, I'm just asking for full disclosure. So you never know what's going to happen as you play around with this industry because there's lots of opportunities. So I'm not against any kind of dogma or any kind of sale or any kind of profits as long as you tell the whole truth. Federal Trade Commission, whoa, real, what's real? Here it is. What is it? Section number 23.27, FTC. Misuse of the word real. I said that diamond's real?  No, they are not real. It is unfair and deceptive to use the word real, genuine, natural, precious, semi-precious, or similar in terms to describe any industry product that is manufactured or produced artificially. Some of these synthetic yuts and putzes, they say, oh, Robert, what you're calling it synthetic? How could you call it synthetic? Well, here's the definition. Cambridge, good Cambridge, good university, Cambridge University Press. What is synthetic in artificial substance or material matter?  Handmade gem products are known as synthetics. So I guess Cambridge is okay with the terminology of music, even though some marketers don't like it. Back to real stuff. So we're talking about real diamonds. Real diamonds are not just sparkly things. That's not a real business. Again, if you want to sell spark, we'll go to Swarovski. They're valuable. They're really valuable. They support the livelihood of millions. Not just millions. Millions of the poorest people in the world. Real diamonds are about commitment.  I know the world is changing. Certainly I'm in business 45 years. I was born 1952 the world's different Okay, but the idea of commitment once upon a time sex and marriage had a relationship Marriage children had a relationship Sex marriage and children had a relationship that was called family now. I'm not against anybody for any reason I love them that they or whatever, but I'm not  against cis. I'm not against cis people that decide to get married and have kids blah blah blah. So I'm looking at the world and I think we're now entering the post-tinder era, okay? I guess women are getting older and they get older, they want to have kids, maybe the terrible realization that they got to sleep with the same guy for a while comes upon them. But fundamentally we are in the post-tinder era. People are getting older, millennials are getting older every day. So when we think about the idea of  family and we think about the big thing which is commitment. Are you able to make a commitment and then you give someone the great value? Yeah it's worth adding five or ten of your golf clubs. It's worth two months of salary which was a great idea. But now you're giving someone something and in a relationship between a man living in a cis world, you know she's jumping up and down not because she just got a ring but because she got a pie. She's a man who says I will love you, I will be with you for the rest of your life.  thousand real things for some people, for a lot of people, for most people. So this idea of commitment, and you gotta understand, I understand where Melinda was coming from because 50% of their parents are divorced. I understand that. But the fact is that we are still coming back to a world where 50% of your parents weren't divorced and people do want to have a commitment. And what does a commitment mean? It means emotional and financial security. If you want to understand the real diamond business, understand the need that people have for real emotional and financial security.  If you really want to understand the diamond business, understand that. Understand that commitment, that gift of commitment. That's the basis of what we're selling. It's important that we really understand that.  and the real value of real diamonds. I play a very short video right now. And this is probably the strongest thing I could ever show you.  I was all terribly thirsty and I said, wasse, wasse. And a boy when the rain came back to me, it's later with a bucket of water. Took the pearls, gave me drinks, then saved my life. And I said, no.  You're not Jewish. You don't understand Judaism. Perhaps you don't understand diamonds, really. But you could be a divorced Arab woman whose only assets after a divorce are her jewelry. You could be a Russian running away from Putin whose only assets are your wife's jewelry. You could be a family running away from communist China. It could be you, your wife, your kids, you.  That is what the real diamond business is about. Real security. Sometimes life-saver. How many people after the war were able to reestablish themselves because of it? So cut out this bullshit about sparking. Really understand diamonds. But I get emotional, so let's move on. Mixing synthetics. Dishonest companies are mixing synthetics in general. We should hang them like hummer.  Synthetics are not a threat to natural if and only if we can detect them. We are honest enough to disclose them. Here's the killer. We can differentiate them. We can actually separate them from the good stuff, the real stuff. Now, this is becoming a very big problem with Mellie. Beers, Roses, Mellie prices, natural Mellie prices, 30% in the first two months of this year. Natural diamond prices will fall  to synthetic prices which are going to be garbage. We cannot separate the goods. It's not enough to detect them as I'll show you in a minute. We have the technology of detection, but we have to improve the technology of differentiation and separation. We are the largest recycler of diamonds in the world today. This is just one parcel that may come to us. I can tell you, do a sample, tell you between 0.8% and one test and 2% and another test that these goods are synthetic.  porn chops, which means that already two, three years ago, synthetics would have been put into the mix. But, see the little red dots? That's what the synthetics are in that, and that's a cut from that parcel. And that parcel's, I don't know, a thousand carats or something. Do you know how long it would take to sit there with a tweezer and look at the picture and then pull out the stones? Minus two and a half, minus six and a half, minus sixes? We have to do more, and I'm very happy to speak out for the GIA, about the GIA,  They're getting machines down there getting the technology and we're gonna have to use it and the question is gonna be how much more is a parcel of diamonds that's 100% guaranteed not to contain any synthetics from parcels that are mixed that you can't pull them out with a tweezer. This is like terrible work. So the technology of not just detection but the technology of differentiation is key and this is probably one of the most important things that we need to do.  Now, the recycled ones. I'm so happy we bring recycled American single stones, four grains, and whatever up, whatever. The whole type of single stones here to Israel. And we do it. And Israelis make Parnassus. They make a living from these stones. Hundreds of people actually come and buy the goods. And that's wonderful, because that's the mitzvah. Recycled goods, they come back in the market and they get bid on those values in those efficient market. And we actually give weight, and we give Parnassus, we give sustenance to  So synthetics are destroying the ability for small traders to buy recycled diamonds off the street from retailers. In America we have lots of people running around buying these goods from these retailers. Mrs. Schwartz comes in, I have a diamond, I have a necklace, I have a tennis bracelet. I would like to sell it to you Mr. Jeweler. The jeweler buys it and then ranks it up and sells those diamonds. But how do you get the text synthetics in the road? Who bears the cost of this? The cost of testing reduces the price consumers get for the recycled natural diamonds.  natural diamonds. So when the goods are mixed together, not by evil mixers, just because that's the way the goods are in the jewelry. This is another story. But what happens here? So we're actually reducing the value of that. I don't believe this nonsense about big diamonds. You know, maybe short term, one year people come and they say I'm going to buy a three carat, a five carat big engagement ring. They just don't know they're getting screwed yet, but they'll find out about it pretty soon. So the issue over here is that synthetics are a nightmare  for larger companies to use them as test and retest. How do you remove those diamonds from the melee parcels? How do you know when you go to a jewelry store in the United States and you're buying a ring that all the diamonds in there are natural? How do you know? How do you know about the diamond business? Yeah, but it's diamond people. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you.

I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start with you. I want to start  Consumers deserve the market value, fair market value, when reselling their diamond. So it's important for us to clean up that market as well. And I'm thinking about this thing over here. Best opportunities. You realize the United States is the largest polished diamond mine in the world? There's tremendous opportunities there for everybody, but particularly the US jewelers. US jewelers will make more money buying diamonds and selling them, buying diamonds from consumers and selling them. And here's why.  Look at these numbers. Do you realize that there are 42 million Americans aged 70 plus? And there's going to be 57 million to 60% of the population. My friends, diamonds are forever. Little old ladies are not. So what's going to happen to all those diamonds? We can buy them, we can make money from them, we can recycle them. It's a great opportunity. And look at those millennials. Those millennials, bigger millennials, older  I like the Gen Z's by the way. But anyways, 26% of the population. And here's the big jump, some of these millennials, not all, are the most miserable people I've ever met. Not all of them, but a lot of them are great. But some of them are just quiet quitters. Actually, maybe that's one generation. See, they're becoming nicer as they get older, all the time. Do you realize these people are going to inherit more money than you can possibly imagine? Trillions of dollars. Because all of these 70 years of  the copters, I'm one of them, are going to die one day and their money that they've been saving all their life that's going to go to their children are not going to know what to do with it. Maybe they'll buy the jewelry if we're smart. If our natural diamond, you see guys do their shtick, right? There's tremendous opportunity, my friends. Unbelievable opportunity just looking at demographics. Now, America, it's different. American buyers, consumers, well, basically a pain in the  in the ass. They are, but that's because they're Americans. No, it's fault, okay? But America's been doing like 48 to 54% of the diamonds they're working. So this is the beer's day. And this is like the wholesale stuff. Not that much different when you look at the jewelry stuff, the diamond jewelry stuff. But the bottom line is that America is where the action's gonna be. Now I love China, China's a great place. Xi Jinping,  That's a great. They're a bunch of communists. Well, like I said you I hope that everything will be fine and there will not be any Well, I'm gonna talk about economic warfare in a few minutes But I don't know how lucky you guys are gonna get selling a bunch of diamonds to a bunch of communists because the communism in China is on the rise and I'm not against communism necessarily But I'm just thinking realistically. Hey, you know, where's the diamond business gonna be? One thing I could tell you I hope China continues and I hope China will prosper and they'll make agreements with America  and everything will be okay, but if you don't have America, talking to my fellow members of the Israel Diamond Exchange, if you don't have America, you're screwed. I don't know how to put that easier. So America's really important, and I want to make that point. And I'm not going to show you all the statistics, I don't have the time for that here, but I can show you tons and tons of statistics that show America is important. Also, America has some problems too, but it's a bit there. Now, sanctions. Sanctions. Sanctions, sanctions, sanctions.  Sanctions is like a funny little word. It's like the beginning of an economic world war. I don't think anyone likes it. There are a lot of smart people in this room. But let's try to be realistic. Well, we hope and pray for the best. The war in creation and China and America just loving each other. President Biden, the capital Pete, because he's the president of the United States. My president. You know, I don't think it'll long. I hope that they work things out.  I really do. But, you know, there's problems and so even more than because we want to be in denial, probably not such a smart thing. So let's consider the reality of the current political, economic, and social realities. When Prime Minister Biden says, you got to be more, you know, you got to be more communist, man. There's a key phrase he's so effective. We got to distribute the wealth. Everybody's got to share. Okay. And every time he says that, Jack Ma's knees shake. Okay. But the truth of the matter  is that it's a communist valued country. And I'm not going to rule whether communism is good or bad. I'm simply going to say to you, it's different. It's social. And it's something that goes right to the root of the way that the world runs. So it's not about Russia. Russia's invasion has triggered a series of economic sanctions. So good we're not, oh, we started shooting, they knocked down our drone a couple of days ago. But the fact of the matter is that it's not a hot war, it's an economic war. We make no mistake.  economic war going on that is probably going to intensify. And everyone's looking at Russia, well the real story is China, but we'll get to that. So it's likely that whatever happened triggered a bunch of events that are intensifying now, and we are in real economic warfare with the United States, the EU, the G7, maybe the Western world all kind of on one side, and you got Russia and China, they just meddled this week I think, a couple days ago, and you've got Iran there,  to kind of poke the bear a little. And then you've got all these other countries sitting on the side. What's going on with these guys? How do we make money from this? And you know, Dubai's the new Hong Kong. And again, you don't have to be a genius to figure that out, because the Indian government, they think Prime Minister Modi's a wonderful man and everything, but he blew the opportunity for India to be a diamond trading center by taxing the imports of the diamonds, because some of the, some of their Indian friends, diamond dealers, et cetera,  convinced them that we have to protect our market and really I'm India's the third biggest market so maybe there's a point there that's another discussion. Bottom line they lost that on being a trading center. Bottom line Dubai and Ashwin over here, boom-ba let's go baby faster faster and if you're cutting diamonds in Botswana now because the beers of Botswana government said hey what's the more manufacturing Botswana you can't send the Polish back to India you may not want to send it to Hong Kong off it goes to Dubai. So Dubai is just gonna grow and  grow and grow because of different rules and laws that all kinds of non-mind-filled people make. Whatever it is, that's the story. I don't control the weather, I don't control what happens, I try to be aware of what's going on, but it looks to me like Dubai's the new Hong Kong. It's good to give Dubai responsibilities. Anyways, we are at the first stages of global economic world war. Like no mistake about it. It's not just Russia and the US, China's exercising its military might while forcing Communist Party  rule over its economy and society. That's what's happening. Read the economists, I read the economists religiously so maybe it's there too. Existing USS on China likely to expand. Look I didn't show you the graph about China but in fact the United States is giving the Chinese a 3, 400, maybe 500 billion dollars a year of extra trade. So the economics of the relationship between the United States and China, you got China expanding in the South China Sea, building their military and then you got America  America giving them 500 million dollars a year. Billion. A year. They keep doing this. I guess eventually China's gonna start building fake islands around the United States. But the point here is, this idea of money, idea of trade, is coming on really strong. We can expect greater sanctions enforcement. Currency warfare. My currency against yours. And competition for scarce resources. In fact, what is going on is,  trade is now a national security issue. A trade is being weaponized. I don't want to shoot bombs at you. Let me see if I can control you by controlling how much money you get. And that is what's really happening right now. And not only is it happening, I'm predicting it's going to get more intense. So we've got to understand what that means for our diamond business, okay? The role of diamonds as a source of military funding is under  are increasing scrutiny to governments, diamonds, or money. I'm afraid of synthetics, governments know what diamonds really are. They understand the real value of diamonds, and they look at it as money. Money that can be used to buy tanks, money that can be used to give Iran money to have a better war against Ukraine, all kinds of buying and all kinds of money. Which is also a clarion call for Dubai.  make sure that at least if we're going to sell our diamonds, I can't control. Let me just keep going. Complicating matters of diamond markets in neutral countries. Where India, such as India and Dubai, as well as regions in Africa and Asia, where it's perfectly legal to trade with both the US and China. I mean, that's normal. Why shouldn't a new white company buy diamonds from Melrose, polish them, and sell them to China? Why not? It's perfectly legal. So I've got this bifurcation of markets  where I've got this US, no, no, no, go straight, go straight, EU, G7, go straight, and then I can dance, I can dance, I can do whatever I want, which is fine. Don't blame people for being legal. But here I am living in this, I get zoo, where all the animals are out of the cages. So how am I supposed to deal with America? How am I supposed to buy goods? So diamonds are perfectly legal in one area and illegal in another, and yet they move freely across these boundaries.  ethical factors so it's not enough the law we'll try and self Tiffany guys because ethical factors are also calculating sourcing this brands and others happen dealers you in the US retailers I'll be the AGS conclave in a few weeks right see to enforce standards that exceed even legal obligations so we're an interesting world where things are changing and the old diamond is just buying selling I worry about where it came from is changing rapidly  significantly legally and ethically. So be aware of that everybody. And this is one of the greatest opportunities you're ever going to have in your generation. You know, for just the Pesach, there's haq samayach to everybody coming to Pesach. Pesach is an amazing holiday. We celebrate the freedom of the Jews from Egypt, the splitting of the seas, splitting of the diamond markets. And there's a special mitzvah on Pesach that comes before Pesach.  who knows the mitzvah? No? Give charity. But where's the mitzvah of... just the day before Pesach, what's the mitzvah? There's a special mitzvah to look for the chameit. You don't just sit there and say, I want the diamond from George, I didn't ask him where it came from, da da da da. You gotta go out there, you gotta take a candle and a feather and you gotta creep around your house and you gotta look for the brums, look for the brums baby. That's the new definition of compliance in the diamond industry. So the diamond  industry has an opportunity to become kosher for pencil. If we do compliance right. Now it doesn't mean the other diamonds are bad necessarily. It doesn't mean that you can't have all kinds of cookies before and after, or whatever you want. If you want to be kosher, there's an opportunity. I was reading the statistic, 40% of products in the United States stores of kosher have OU certification or other certification as kosher. But only like 4%  are Jews and most of them are in kosher. We find out that non-Jews are buying most of the Jewish kosher products. It's weird, it's amazing. Why? Because they perceive kosher products to be healthier, more original, or whatever the idea that is. That's amazing, that's just the real statistics. My friends, you want to make money in this business with all this crap going on? Kosher.  Diamonds. Kosher diamonds.  triple X this because I will do whatever you want me to do if I can make more money doing it it's a cold adding value one of the greatest opportunities for the diamond industry in general and for the Israeli diamond industry in particular and for you you you me is to add value to the products we sell I'm monitoring them by knowing where they come from maybe knowing where they go to also so this is an added value story this is an opportunity  to make money. Or I would say in Chinese, weiji. Weiji is a Chinese phrase that means difficulty or challenge, opportunity. Wherever there's a challenge, there's an opportunity. Wherever there's a problem, there's a way to turn it around and make more money from it. That's how we have to think in our diamond industry. So knowing where your diamonds come from has become imperative for increasing numbers of buyers. This is promoting the integration and verticalization of the supply chains. Sophisticated  And diamond tracing technologies are developing. Bruce talked about tracing to the brain. Surinzo-ing stuff. Let there be a thousand light candles, as they used to say in China. Let there be all different technologies. Let's use them to have kosher. I can get a kosher meal in Dubai. I can get a kosher meal in Mumbai. I should get a kosher diamond in New York. So the idea of adding value to diamonds  by monitoring where they're coming from and using technology to do that shouldn't be difficult, shouldn't stretch it. The challenge for the diamond trade now, here's the problem, because the big companies can do it easier than the smaller companies, the challenge of diamond trade is to create source certification schemes that enable the participation of smaller companies, dealers, members of our clubs in a transparent supply chain. Source certification has to be like a GIA certificate that goes with the diamond so you can buy it, sell it a hundred times,  and you always know where the diamond came from. So we don't want to stop trade, we don't want to stop competition, we don't want to stop all those good things, okay? But what we do want to do is we want to promote the idea that we are dealing with something that we have path in a sentence culture. Every Sunday we are being stymied by governments, not governments. Governments are governments. They're just not bad, they're not good, they're not your daddy, they're not your mommy, they're governments. And they do what they have to do based on their considerations.  US government, particularly the US government. And I'm wearing the flag and I believe in America and I love America and I love President Biden, I love all our presidents, but governments are screwing up. They fail to clarify the rules of the game. Governments are confused. They don't know what they're doing. At this stage, the US does not know what they should do to ensure companies, let's say to ensure companies with sanction regulations. They don't understand the diamond business.  A lot of people don't understand the diamond business, but really, honestly, they don't know what they're doing. They don't even communicate what the current sanctions regulations are. So I'm getting all upset about this. We sent letters, we're nice guys, but now we're getting a little bit more roughy, aggressive, I would say. So we have a problem over here. Governments come along, and I want to tell you, you know who the real hero of the Kiprily process is? It's the guy by the name of Harold Jeter, the unsteppard of the state,  in 1999, who I convinced to go with the idea of kosher diamonds. So I said to Arnold Jeter, I said, listen, we know where the arms are coming from that are going into Liberia. You can actually find them in the Red Oaks. Why don't you stop those arms? Why don't you stop sending machetes and guns to the Liberians who are killing these poor Sierra Leoneans? He had to do it, Mr. Alaport. He said, geez, why not?  agreement with the government, by the way I think it was Iranian, we have an agreement with the government that if they give us the nuclear weapons, we're not going to bother them about the sale of conventional weapons. That's interesting. So sometimes we don't understand governments, what they do, why they do it, and maybe they're right. Nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists, maybe that's a good trade off. If it's not high call, it certainly is the president's call. So when we look and we watch governments, we have to understand they have different  They're not here to protect our industry. They're here to protect their government interests. When you put all the governments together in a room, you get all kinds of horrible stuff because they're all looking after themselves. So don't blame the governments. Just be aware that there are things going on that may not be in our interest. So we have to worry about government regulations messing things up. So quickly, Russian invasion in February.  supplies 30% of the world's rough diamonds. March 11th, President Biden issues an executive order, pertaining importation of non-industrial diamonds to the Russian Federation. Origin. He uses the word origin. The phrase origin has significant legal meaning, implying that it excludes diamonds from Russia that have been substantially transformed, cut outside of Russia. Since almost all the diamonds coming out of El Rosa were manufactured out of Russia,  The President's executive order had almost no impact on the supply of diamonds other than some banking regulations. The origin loophole rendered the President's executive order ineffective. Now, one second. Why would the President of the United States issue an ineffective executive order that did not reduce the cash flow to Russia? I have a tremendous amount of respect for the President, less so for the State Department,  But what's going on here? Maybe India's a nuclear power, Pakistan's a nuclear power, maybe there's bigger fish to fry, maybe we did this and then there's advisers saying, but you can do it, but you can't really do it. But the bottom line is the US government is screwing around, which is not good for our industry in a world that I just described with all these different political and economic interests. So, oh further, on seven then the Department of Treasury said they didn't use the word sanctions, but they said  Al-Rozah is now a blocked entity. It is a sanctioned entity. So does that mean that you could buy diamonds that are coming from Al-Rozah and put in India or Israel and then sell to America? Is that okay? Is it not okay? Does anybody know if it's okay? Does anyone have the guts to ask? Is it okay? I do. So I sent the letter and also we told everybody don't put your Russian diamonds, source diamonds, that even if they're coming in here elsewhere, don't put them around there. But  position the diamond trade the United States jewelry council that it's okay to import diamonds that are from Russian rough cut outside So after some consultation with the leaders I sent a letter to O FAC in the end of February that said this please answer the following questions and Is it permissible for us entities us companies to trade or import into the United States?  after the sanctions whereby the dials were manufactured or substantially transformed outside of Russia by non-sanctioned. Tell me, Rabbi, what's kosher? Rabbi, he doesn't tell you. I said, this substantial transformation of product purchased from the sanctioned entity rendered the resultant product free of this exact words I used today. Oh, it's the foreign asset controlled by the United States Department of Treasury. I asked the question. I don't know why no one else asked the question. I said, no, it was gonna be  So far OFAC is hiding. I'm hiding. I'm OFAC. I send people to jail. I'm terrorist organization responsible. But I'm hiding from the whole diamond industry. Well, I'm not going to let them hide. This is ridiculous. Sir, we need to have a level playing field. We need to know what's really going on. So that's one issue. But it gets worse.  The US State Department is pretty much controlling and the US State Department, they're nice people, honestly. But they work for government and the government has other interests. They talk out of both sides of the mouth. They're the fine, wonderful people who have now voted Zimbabwean as the chair of the Gimberley process. Wow. I mean, that's like asking not just the fox to guard the chicken coop, it's like, you know, roasting the chickens. In any case, it's worse than that.  According to Ofex sanctions, if an entity, say a Russian oligarch, owns 51% of a company, or three different oligarchs, or maybe, I don't know, it could be a minister from some African country, and he owns that business more than 51%, and you trade with that business, you are now a terrorist yourself. Do you know the beneficial owners of the companies you deal with? Do you guys really know that?  Why do I know that? Should we know that? Somebody answer the question. So we get ourselves set up with governments that put us into positions that are kind of, well, I can tack you if I want. If I'm not, I can play with you, not accept it. Now another thing is how far do you go? I buy from A, A buys from B, B buys from C, C was maybe a sanction entity. How do I know? What does that mean for our free market?  That's just retailers in the United States, it's dealers here in Israel and Dubai and India everywhere. What about our industry? So we need to get clarity on what the rules are. Okay? Can you trade in on these markets? It's our intention to work with other trade leaders and our U.S. congressional representatives. Congress cares about what we think. The administration, lesson. Bureaucrats come and meet, the bureaucrats tend to stick around, but political appointees tend to come and go. So we're going to go to Congress and we're going to try to find out the truth of what is going on in the South.  Major step forward would be adoption and integration of source certification systems in Rampant that doesn't require Washington, which would start putting green stars in Rampant. If we have diamonds, the polished diamonds would be nowhere to rough game from. That's what we're working on and we think this is the direction because then everybody can see how much is a green star diamond worth more than a non-green star diamond. How much does it cost to get a green star diamond? And so those things are going to be there. The way forward, given the fact that ASSIST-TRIBIS-MARCIS-G7-OVER-WEBS-OVER-MODE will require higher levels of sources  We're working with those of which to establish rational compliance standards that can be approved by US. US market support and we need cloud. We'll also be working with our congressional representatives to ensure fair regulations, if necessary legislation that enables a level playing field for board range of trade persists to disciplines between Israelis. A particular issue is greenwashing by import sanctions, goods under cover and then complete competing US  So here I am selling a kosher diamond, here he is selling a not kosher diamond, and he's selling it against me. And I'm in the US with all these laws, he doesn't have to follow the laws, and he's cheaper than me. How am I supposed to do that? I'm not even talking about a case where someone bribes somebody in Africa, gets the roof 30% cheaper, cuts it, and then sells it polished against me. In OFAC's case, you go to jail. In other cases, you're writing off as a business expense. So this level of playing field is important. I'm calling upon the US administration, the Department of Treasury,  of Foreign Assets Control to reply to our request for clarification regarding the importation into the US of Russian-sourced buyouts, which is Israel-Ferroso and then manufactured outside. We call upon the United States Federal Trade Commission, as well as the World Federation of Diamond Borsas, INMA, and the RJC trade organizations to clarify their position regarding full disclosure of scarcity and value retention for the sale of synthetic diamonds, particularly when the sales compares  We're going to affect you. Fearless, do not put Russian source, even if it's kind of outside of Russia, on rap. Don't do it. If we find you, throw you down. I'm begging you, don't put it on our table.  The current situation provides many opportunities for members of the trade to add value to the diamonds they manufacture, trade, or retail. This is an opportunity to get higher prices for our diamonds, everybody, by something that we do, which is to trace their source. Kosher gets a higher price. That's a zero, almost a zero. While different markets will require different standards based on the rules of the countries, the written, the ethnic standards of the market participants who they sell to, there is sufficient room for cooperation  and standardization of procedures that will enable legal and ethical compliance for the markets we wish to serve.
