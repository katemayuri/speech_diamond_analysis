 This podcast is brought to you by GIA, the Gemological Institute of America, protecting consumers and supporting the global gem and jewelry trade since 1931 through research, education and laboratory services.  Diamond Podcast. This is Joshua Friedman, Senior Analyst at Rappaport. And our guest today is Devansh Shah, partner at Venus Jewel, one of India's largest diamond manufacturers. This company specializes in large and fancy cut diamonds and has a unique story as a pioneer in the Indian market, as you'll find out in this episode. Devansh and I also talked about the latest developments in the diamond trade, the future of the Surat diamond bourse, and what's been driving the strength in India's domestic jewelry market. We recorded it on  May the 7th before the JCK Las Vegas show. Enjoy the conversation.  By sharing that with our listeners, can you tell me about how how Venus Jules developed, how you became a big name in particular in the large stones and fancies and what the story is there? First of all, many thanks for having me join this podcast, join the conversation. We are now a 55 plus year old company that has been in the same place for all this while in Surat and in Mumbai. We've changed our locations, but the heart has remained the same. It is my grandfather's who  started this company more than 55 years ago and their vision has been very clear and probably the driving factor for keeping us the way we are and keeping us growing and strong. They have always been very keen on ensuring that we understand the consumers and our customers very, very well and that we innovate very boldly and very strongly to keep ourselves ahead of the needs and  requirements and to ensure that we are serving the best we can and that simple equation has been our power for the last 50 years and will be so for the next many. And as you mentioned about the large stones and the fancy shapes. So our company has been very strongly focused on very meticulous craftsmanship. So our craftsmen are amongst the best craftsmen that the industry has  To be able to afford them was the primary reason we moved into larger pieces and fancy shapes so that we were able to command the value addition that would be necessary to justify the highly paid and highly valued craftsmen. And that gradually became our complete new identity and our complete new focus.  2 carat plus, right?  India was not still doing these goods and he had his own commitment to his work and also his strong vision that India could do this, which was in many ways not considered possible for India to do, but he was very committed to ensure that he can give it his best try and then it worked out and it worked out well for us, for many of our family, friends and relatives and gradually  the whole industry then transformed into being able to manufacture more than 90% of the world's diamonds. Right. Now there's a perception that the large high value goods are manufactured in Antwerp, Israel, New York, and India is more of a mass market. But that's changing really. I mean, that's India's moving higher and higher up the value kind of hierarchy, isn't it? Absolutely. I think the perception probably is still taking time to change. But the reality is  has already changed. The world now has seen the possibility of India making the most expensive and the most important diamonds that are possible to craft.  driving the increased focus on fancies in the manufacturing sector?  look at many celebrity engagement rings and many of the showstoppers from all the leading brands in the world. They all are predominantly covered by fancy shaped diamonds and naturally I think these influences gradually move into the general consumers acceptance and today our own manufacturing is also more than 70% just fancy shaped diamonds and they definitely require a different level  of attention, different level of craftsmanship and detailing. And for the consumer, they approach it as something different, but not anymore as risky as a fancy diamond would be referred to as earlier. And now many shapes like ovals, emeralds, pairs, cushions, radians, they're now considered as very normal investment grade pieces as well, because that would probably be one of the primary worries  What are the most popular shapes for you?  which are in America and India.  first piece to first shape to be affected because they are traded most regularly and most easily and the supply and demand of rounds is affected very sensitively with any economical and global changes and probably that led to the current situation in fancy is because when rounds were affected in that manner, maybe many manufacturers shifted their production lines to  more fancies than earlier and we see that impact very clearly in the square shapes today which would have been the nearest alternatives to making the round shaped diamond, cushions, square emeralds, princesses, they are affected the most in amongst all fancies today and I think the primary reason could be like you mentioned the shift from making rounds to making fancies when rounds were affected  Is there any signs of recovery in Fancy's yet?  that there is not a lot of supply available in every pocket, which makes it a little easier to not panic about the pricing and not panic about the sales. And we have noticed that in fancy shapes, there are these some areas which are exclusive, which don't usually have very quick impacts of the pricing, but the regular areas are affected a little more significantly. So we do see some revivals in some areas where  there is temporary lack of demand and fortunately the industry in India has been very responsible in reducing in many areas above four or five carats. There are some areas where there is enough supply and there are many areas where there is not enough new goods coming into the market, which should be a good sign to balance the supply with the demand. I mentioned at the beginning that I visited your factories just over a year ago as well as a few other manufacturers. One thing I noticed was that there's a very  different culture in each business. What would you say is distinctive about Venus? And also how does running a factory that's mostly fancies differ from running a factory that's mostly round? The main difference is how we work and how our craftsmen work. It's differently designed. Every craftsman is his own manager. We don't have any managers in our factory at all. And the main reason is every craftsman becomes responsible for  his own work very closely and dearly. And with that same reason, all our diamonds are made completely by a single artisan. There is not the usual practice of the table and crown being made by another artisan and then the pavilion and girdle being made by another artisan. At our unit, the whole entire piece, whether it be a 30 cent diamond or a 20 carat diamond, is completely made by a single person.  and they have that personal affection and understanding of the piece in absolute detail and we believe they can take the best care of what is given in their responsibility and that builds a lot of independence for our team to portray and express their best skills and performance and their rewards are also designed in a manner that keeps them motivated to make the best of their work.  independence and the opportunities that they have. In general, most of our craftsmen would have been with us for more than a decade or a decade and a half on average. And this is one of the key reasons we enjoy a very special relationship with all our people. And we know that they enjoy a very special and comfortable environment for working and expressing their art in a skill-filled manner.  I imagine that also if you're looking at supplying origin information to the consumer that there's maybe a slight advantage if you can say that this diamond was cut and polished by this one person. Is that true? We have still not capitalized on that opportunity ourselves yet, but definitely being able to track the progress and process of every diamond and what a particular artisan brings to a piece, whether it was planned as an eight carat, but he made the facets even more beautiful.  beautiful to make it shine better and brought more value to the diamond. We can see very closely the individual value addition that every of our craftsmen and artisan is bringing to each and every piece that they work on. On the issue of traceability, obviously I have to ask about what's happening with Russian diamonds. There's a lot of uncertainty about whether Russian diamonds are getting into the Indian market or not. How has all of this affected you? And particularly, I know there were certain shapes that our Rosa was a particular supplier of.  So how has it affected you?  in regulations. Right, right. Challenges that have affected the market. I mean, there's a lot of them. There's the impact of lab-grown diamonds. There's the interest rates and inflation in the US and other countries. The fact that the drop in travel that happened during COVID has now gone away and people are traveling again. Have you seen as the supplier, you see the trend in sales maybe more than the reason. What's your impression of how all these things have affected the market? So I was in Dallas two weeks ago and I wanted to really get  a ground check on how these things are impacting and affecting our industry. And the feedback I received actually was very surprising. Most retailers there told us that the difference between the two products and the difference in consumer awareness in the two products and the increasing understanding of this new product, Labgrown Diamond is changing very rapidly and they are realizing that most of their consumers are now aware  and making a more informed decision about their purchase. And when they are educated better and informed better, they see as a result that consumers are preferring more natural diamond purchases than lab-grown diamond purchases, especially for the ones that have the capacity to be able to purchase an expensive product. And that cycle probably is going to still take a few years for every consumer to be  able to clearly differentiate and understand the product attributes and the lifetime value of the two different products. And we believe that in the long run, this is definitely going to station itself as a very separate product and not compete in the luxury space with the natural diamonds. And we take inspiration from other industries where the same situation has happened, where a new manmade alternative becomes  viable for the consumer to purchase and when it's introduced there is that initial excitement amongst consumers. However, now consumers more and more clearly understand that both products are in complete different segments. One is in a luxury segment and the other is a fast fashion product and probably they both will have different consumers for themselves. This is what the retailer  felt very confident about and they looked in the future as primarily natural diamond retailer because that's what a luxury environment and a luxury product deserves and that's what they were telling us as a big important feedback and this I believe is going to replicate in other countries as well where lab grown diamonds were introduced to the general consumers much later and they will also gradually go through this education  cycle and price understanding cycle. And once we are through it, both products will ideally have a different position in the market and in different markets, probably.  one carat diamond because of labgro and they were able to go up and buy a two three carat for the same price or maybe a bit more but what they perceived as a much better price so that people ended up buying larger stones but labgro. How did that affect you as a supplier of large natural and did you see any impact on the let's say two three carat naturals from labgro? Actually our supply is going into very you know long-term established wholesalers and retailers who look at the industry from a  long term perspective. And in that sense, a lot of our customers were very confident about the future of natural diamonds from the very beginning throughout this problem of consumer awareness. And our sales actually weren't impacted in a very, very significant manner. You know, not as much as the noise is there in the industry because probably the retailers and the wholesalers who understood the long term future of the two products placed their  confidence and bets in the right direction and we were fortunate to be connected with the right people and the big wholesale houses and most of the nice mom and pop luxury retailers all of them have made it very clear that they backed the natural diamonds product throughout its ups and downs and we didn't see any massive impact in a volume of demand for the two carats and three carats of course there was this price correction  that would impact the total value of what we were able to sell. But we know that the value had gone up also significantly in 2021 and 2022. So looking at it from a purely volume perspective, the impact wasn't as significant as it sounds in general news.

India and China have been very focused on rounds because consumers were very investment savvy and they would believe that rounds are the easiest to trade and the easiest to figure out the value for and in comparison fancy shapes weren't seen so often and in so many options. So they would consider them as, you know, fancy alternatives that weren't the basic investment. So round would be looked at like the  gold bar that you can trade very easily and fancies would be gold jewelry for example that you could trade but it may not be as easy may not yield the same value differential but gradually we know that all these market segments also are accepting fancy shaped diamonds as newer also normal shape to buy because we have seen the increase in volumes of ovals, pears, hearts going into Hong Kong and you know the  Far East, they probably prefer those round edged fancies a little more. And even emeralds have become quite a normal purchase to think about in these segments. And we have had a lot of large Christie's and Sotheby's auctions making such pieces also as aspirational as the round shaped diamonds. And consumers have probably seen these shapes, you know, being present for very long now, and they probably are able to accept it.  as a normal purchase much more now than earlier, especially in the larger sizes above 4 carat. Fancies are leading the production and the supply that we do in the smaller sizes, which probably would be someone's first engagement ring or first purchase. Still rounds are around 50-60% of the market. But in the larger sizes, we definitely see fancies also yielding more weight and value for us and consumers  willing to pay much more for fancies than they would for a round that would come out of the same rough.  and just the options and our sales, for example, of diamonds, four carats and above have been quite normal in these days. We've still been able to maintain the right levels of inventory that we would like to. And they're going off every day. We are getting new ones every day and they're moving quite normally. Right. Okay. And the other thing I wanted to ask about fancies was we mentioned before was the improvement in cut quality. I know that in the past there was an issue of  I think it says for cushions right of crushed ice stones. That's cushions, correct? Yes, that is cushioned. Manufacturers have managed to find solutions to that. Are you able to expand on that? Yes, so the involvement of cut and symmetry in fancies has been very exponential, I would say in the last five to seven years. The understanding of the makes and the understandings of good makes and bad makes, even good light performance coming out of these diamonds and not coming out of these  diamonds and basic awareness of the change in numbers of what are normal tables and normal depths. All of these things has evolved very significantly in the last five to seven years. We are able to make much better fancies ourselves also than what we used to five, seven years or 10 years ago. And despite us even leading the fancy craftsmanship back then, we still had to keep evolving and keep understanding what we can find  tune and what we can improve. Ovals, for example, and pairs had this issue of bowties affecting their makes. Sometimes cushions had ring effects apart from the crushed ice effect that would affect them. And the strong driving factor has been that customers have started asking about these small aspects of these cuts and makes in fancies. Do you have an oval without a bowtie? Do you have a cushion that is without the crushed ice?  effect. And these things make us feel very confident that we should work on these aspects more sincerely and ensure we're delivering the best product to our consumers and exceeding their expectations from us as the leading manufacturer of fancy ships. When you say that customers are asking about these things, is this trade customers, wholesale customers that are asking consumers, I guess, by and large aren't familiar with these terms, but we'll be able to tell if a diamond doesn't look good. That is correct.  The trade consumers have become more knowledgeable and more understanding of the differences in the value and what this actually does is they then become willing to pay a premium for a better piece and that is when a manufacturer like us has nice and strong motivation to ensure we're doing the best. We spend a lot of time educating our consumers about our customers, our trade customers about the small small differences  is  piece better in its symmetry or in its shape would need some weight loss or some loss in the value of the weight that is retained in the diamond. And that needs to be covered up with the ability of the customer to pay more for well-made fancies. And that awareness is definitely significantly shooting up every year.  on in the industry at the moment is the development and the rise of Surat and the Surat Diamond Boars. Obviously Surat has been an important manufacturing center for years and decades, but now it wants to become more of a trading hub. Where do you see this going? So the Surat Diamond Boars is of course an exceptional project in its actual build and in the vision behind the project. It is a very long term project in its capacity and in its potential. I believe that it will take time for the market to  to adapt to this new boos being available to trade from. Trade was already present in Surat even before the boos, but in a much more unorganized, in a much more non-good looking manner with the state of offices and the state of the market there. And the boos would definitely be the right way an industry like ours should be working within itself and with the external world.  its capacity, the makers of the bours have been very long-term visionary in making the bours have enough capacity for a very long time. And it will take time for something so dramatically new and different to be accepted comfortably and confidently. But I believe it is in good interest of the industry for the long run. And gradually it will become a very significant  Has Venus Dual taken space in the new boss? Yes, we do have a large office available there. We are still in the works of getting it ready to start operating from. Right, so at the moment there's no one actually working from there, but it's in development. Yes, it is still in development. Right, and I guess the main benefit of that for you would be the sales office would be closer to where manufacturing happens. Obviously aside from the fact that it's just the cost of land there is lower.  office as of now, we believe the connectivity and the infrastructure available in Mumbai and the years of establishment of a market and sales related outlet in Mumbai has been very strong and is not easy to replace in a very, very short span of time. But we also believe that Surat itself is also a potential trading market and we will establish an additional presence in Boors as well. And then we see how the demand  and supply and inventory keeping can be resolved and managed in both places and we will gradually make a decision based on how things move. But in the current mindset, we are looking at it as an additional sales outlet and we will be able to cater to the local Surat traders and exporters closely from there, then from here.  in the market has actually been the Indian domestic market. It seems like it's actually been possibly the best performing geographical market in the world. We gather it slowed down a little bit maybe because the wedding season has went through a bit of a lull. What do you think is behind the Indian domestic industry, the Indian domestic demand? I think in the last 10 years or so, we have observed exceptional leadership and its exceptional results. We have seen how the whole COVID situation was managed by the country as  probably the best in the world. We have seen how the economic crisis in the world has not affected India as much as it has affected so many other parts of the world. The currency fluctuations also have been weathered and managed so beautifully. I think there is a strong good business acumen in the leadership of the country and of the different ministries and that has definitely led to good results.  for everyone in the country. Looking at it just from a macroeconomic perspective, in the last three years, India's total market capitalization has doubled in just the last three years than what it was three years ago. And I think that is a very clear sign of how well the domestic industry is being organized, picked up, motivated to do well and given opportunities to make  more products in India, for India, for the world and also the services that have grown significantly as an office for the world. And I think all of that indirectly also result into the Indian citizen being and becoming more capable, more confident of their situation in the country. And we have seen that the average Indian is also now able to afford much more  better standard of living, a much better home, a much better living environment than they had earlier. And probably that is what is leading to the domestic market performing so well. Also in our industry, jewellery sales have been very off the chart in recent months and years. And also loose diamond sales in India have, in our perspective, never been so high in India. And they continue to be so even in  the recent few months. You know, in especially in our segment of Solitaire, we have seen that natural diamond Solitaire are much better accepted and much better aspired for in India as of now considering the economic situation and environment. And the stock market is doing well. General businesses in India are doing well. So everything is fortunately working out well for and as a result, we are also  reaping some benefits from that doing well. And another thing that people outside India assume about India is that the domestic market is all about wedding jewelry. But I guess it's it's broadening or firstly, was that ever the case? And secondly, is it broadening? Yes, that we have to accept that was the case. And it's probably still the case in some regions of the country. But you know, India is a very diverse country in that aspect. There would still be some regions where it is still wedding related purchases.  only, but we see most of the metro cities, the larger cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, those are adopting Solitaire and the modern version of jewellery very well and for many more occasions than before. And surprisingly, even the second tier and third tier cities, which in terms of their gross domestic product may not be in the top few, but we are very surprised with the capacity  of India's consumer to buy very expensive diamonds in cities that we would never imagine would be able to have consumers for it. But Solitaire, which is our region, is not so wedding focused in its core essence as well. It is very used very frequently as an anniversary gift, as a special gift for a mother, a special gift for all the daughters and the family.  make solitaire as a prime prospect to purchase and India has learned a little from the Western concept of modern solitaire and that is working out well for the Indian consumer. Is there a split between the north and the south of India in terms of the types of jewelry, the types of diamonds they buy? There are probably a hundred splits in the way India performs. Even within the north, there are segments of  Delhi city being still a little connected to the non-residents of India world, so being connected to the external world, but the rest of the North India still being a traditional market. The South Indian segment also has a mix of the traditional buyers as well as the more modern buyers. But there are too many splits in India to be able to define it and standardize the understanding of the market.  also very different. The West is also very different. Right. It's a large and complex market. Devansh, on that note, I just want to thank you for your insights. I and the listeners, when they listen to this, will learn a lot from what you said. So thank you very much. We've covered a lot of issues in the trade and the consumer markets and fancies in large stones. So it's really been great having you on this podcast and I wish you much success. Thank you so much, Joshua, for having me here. It was an absolute pleasure and it was really good  conversation to have with you and I hope I'm able to add value to the conversation that we had. You certainly have. Thank you.
