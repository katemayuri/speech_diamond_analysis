 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Joshua Friedman.  Diamond Center, the AWDC, the main trade body for the Belgian diamond industry. In this extremely open interview, Izzy spoke about the creation of his family business, the challenges and opportunities facing the Antwerp diamond sector, and gave the inside story on the G7 sanctions and attempts to make Antwerp into the single entry point for Roth. Enjoy the episode.  a background to your company, to Diley Diamond, and how the business came to be. Thank you for having me, Josh. It's a real privilege. It's an honor. It's a pleasure. When you invited me for this podcast interview, I asked a good friend if I should accept it because it's really not my style. No, my friend replied, number one, it's your style. And on my advice, you should apply your business rhetoric to the interview. Breathe straightforward and honest.  So here I'm hoping I won't offend anyone. Let me start about the Dali Diamond history. I find it difficult to speak about myself as it's written in the scripture that self-praise is not really commendable. However, credit for Dali Diamond goes entirely to the first generation, to the founders of Dali Diamond, my father, my uncle, and a good friend of the company Abraham Hollander.  The story is a story of triumph and survival. My father and uncle, along with parents and four additional siblings, escaped from Poland to Kazakhstan during the war. After the war, they received refugee papers, visas to move to Belgium. And Artur was the obvious choice. It was a choice where all refugees from all over the world were accepted with open hands. It was government policy. It was also the famous mayor of  the town of Kreibers, who wanted very much to rebuild the diamond industry, the diamond business. I knew the right ingredient is to try to get back survivors from the war. People who had linked to artwork to rebuild it. So that's how my father, my uncle landed here with the four brothers and sisters and my grandparents. It was a very interesting scene in Belgium as the mayor  and some survivors who lived already in Belgium were waiting for people in the train station to pick them up and to say, no time to speak, let's go to work. And that was the flourishing new diamond industry of cleavers and polishers who started. So with a very modest start, we were able to build with the first generation what we accomplished today.  the site holder and the large player in the diamond industry that it is today.  as well. So that's how Dali was created more than 70 years ago. They started as cleavers. I don't know if young Josh who knows what's cleaving, cleaving was preparers. That was two-stage, was preparers of the rough. And then it went to people who used to manufacture. So they were the cleavers and dealers of rough. And they gained the name of honesty, of transparency, of right ethic behavior.  Much before it was compulsory, it was their choice. They believed that's the survival. And that's how they created the business. When the second generation came in, they decided it's time to flirt a little bit with polish. And that's how we started to manufacturing rough into polish. And that's how we created a quite strong net of polish sales all over the world. And especially our relation with the brands who is quite more than 30 years.  who is a cornerstone in the cleanish goods in Europe, came into an obvious part of the business. So we had from one side the preparing business, the dealing business in Routh, and then we had the Polish business. Needless to say, in the 1980s, the Russian came, Malroza came into the game. Once they separated with their commitment and contract with the beers, and they were looking for clients.  was one of the first clients in Russia in the rough. We then already decided that beneficiation is the right key to business. We manufactured a lot of smaller goods in Gomel, Belarus. It's funny that my father always said he was safe during the war in Kazakhstan. He always mentioned when you see, today it's not so popular to say it on the podcast, but he said when you see Russian officials, thank him again that thanks to the Russian  the war.  started with a turnover of 50,000. We grew it into a consolidated turnover of 850 million. And mainly the turnover was done here in Belgium was about 500 million. So our attachment, our link with artwork as being here and having our headquarters is steadfast. And how focused has the firm been on those top luxury brands? I'm obviously not asking you to name any names of clients, but what proportion of your  revenue has come from those top jewelry houses? At least 30 or 40 percent of the revenue from the Polish goods coming from the cleanish goods. We have clients in France, we have clients in Switzerland, we have clients in USA. And again, it goes a little bit with our motto of long term vision of consistency and not being afraid to keep inventory and also with commitment. And this gives us a little bit of consistency to be able to be one of the top supplies.  We have an office in Paris, so we're closer to the brands. And through this, we also receive certain privileges of having the first orders and to know the market tendency by the luxury products to know what we can expect for the next six months. And when you say not fearing holding inventory, you mean you'll buy when there's even if you think it might take a while until we manufacture, even when we believe it can take a longer period.  the last six months, we felt it a little bit. The appetite was very much decreased, but we knew its products, the appetite will come back. And we made sure to have enough inventory, again, to follow a motto, a slogan to say we never say no to a supply. Does that approach require a lot of financing? We have ample financing. Everything starts with financing, but starts also in belief in the product. We believe in diamonds. We believe in natural diamonds.  and we supported in the last 50 years, we made money on inventory and we feel very confident about it. Right. So you are now the president of the board of the AWGC, the Antwerp World Diamond Center. How did you get involved in the AWGC? That's a good question. And my involvement was first to be a part of the board. The reason, how would they say, is, according to me, the most important organization here now. It's the organization has the power to defend us to the government.  on, it was built for this, it was built on the request of the bears and the federation of the bros, that we want to have one unified point whenever we have a problem or we need to find a solution to come over and to arrange it. So that's how the R&D was born. Being like I mentioned before that our turnover is about 70 or 80 percent in artwork, I felt that we have to do everything to be able to defend and to make attractive  artwork on the best. So that's how it's quite obvious that if you want to be somewhere involved to guarantee that artwork will survive, it wouldn't be enough to be in the inner walls of Dali Diamond, but you have also to make sure to be quite on the society helpful to support the concept to the government, to the EU and to what we'll mention later to the G7.  I started asking a few podcast guests, can you describe your typical day? It's very interesting what you're asking me because honestly, I don't really have a typical day. The most typical thing that I do is I wake up quite early every morning, I decide to exercise, I go down to the exercise room, I check the new fancy machines that my wife bought, and then I think, you know what, tomorrow is another day, and I'm going up again.  serious note, I don't think anyone is really interested in knowing my schedule, but I appreciate the question. Honestly, a dedicated diameter has always his mind 24-6, always thinking, how can I make my gem glitter more? Talmudic study is an integral part of my day, offering me profound inspiration and valuable lessons on the conduct from Jewish books,  Jewish Talmud and Jewish law.  I tend to always notice opportunities more than challenges. Let me give you some examples. Luckily, we have, fortunately enough, a lot of support from the Belgian government. When we started to feel competition from other centres with zero tax level, the AWC introduced the innovative, as I'm sure you're familiar with, the Carat tax. Just explaining for the audience, modelled after the tonnage tax that the artwork  Port enjoys. This means that we pay tax on turnover, not on profit. Additionally, the high level of compliance in artwork was a burden, but helped us tremendously to maintain a market reputation for ethics, transparency, and integrity. Another example, when ADB KBC, I think was 15 years ago, closed their door to the diamond industry, it posted a significant challenge,  to Antwerp because no more Belgian banks were involved. Fortunately, the industry adapted by discovering more innovative financing solutions through Guggenheim channel and Clarity. I find that in Antwerp, we proved the last 100 years, we have a certain strength of renovators to adapt ourselves and finding the right model to be able to survive  not only to survive, but also to thrive and to be significant in the industry. Would you say that the decline in financing was the cause of Antwerp's difficulties, if you can call it that, or the other way around? Is it because the importance of Antwerp waned, banks became less? No, I think it definitely started with the Belgian banks with new form of regulation after the 2008-2009 problem of the KBC and they decided to wind down.  And per accident or not per accident, they put the ADB bank in commitment to sell or to liquidate it. And I think had a huge impact. But again, we were able to find even a good formula with the MBF and Dubai bank was ready to finance Belgium diamond test. We found this alternative financing like Guggenheim channel and clarity together financing now over a billion dollar. So it's mostly only receiving  And at the same time, do you feel that Dubai has taken away some of the business that in the past would have been Antwerp?  I believe Dubai has certain advantages that Belgium didn't have. And I believe that Belgium has advantages that Dubai doesn't have. I will give you one example. I believe very much that Belgium is today a favorite place for the brands to buy polished. They believe the integrity, transparency is quite very important that they can only have in Antwerp. I believe, and this is maybe not proven yet, that Belgium  Artwork positioned themselves to be only a market for natural diamonds. There is no market here for lab grown goods. I believe this is a huge advantage for long term for Artwork too. How it will be proven that to be only dedicated to natural, only have finance for natural, locally is an advantage. When the lab grown and natural diamonds came into question a few years ago, I just want to tell you a little remark from my father,  He told me a story about one of the industry leaders, his name was Sam Pearl. He was quite active in all kinds of charity organizations, school organizations. In 1940, he had to run away due to the German Nazi occupation. And he ran away in Skolten, Dagen, in the Kampen, and he was living in a farm. In order to survive and to pay for protection, he had a bag of diamonds. And every Friday, he paid his grand.  grocery, whatever he needed, and his protection by the group of farmers who protected him with a diamond. Miraculously, when his bank was empty with diamonds, with the natural diamonds, the Americans came to save Belgium, to save Europe, and was able to kill the German Nazi occupation. So my father said, do you think he would be able to survive with a bag of Lapkrone? And he did not yet.  the reduction of prices that we submitted. So I believe that the natural diamond correlation and connection with artwork is very, very strong and it's a huge advantage. I believe also somehow what we'll discuss later, the huge disadvantage of sanctioned goods can play that with the only source, the only country, only city rough imported, that sanction of Russian  of  The focus immediately was on Antwerp because every year of Alrosa sales data that much as big as market for sales of rough diamonds. How did Antwerp respond to that? It's a good question. Antwerp had to respect the sanctions. There was never a question to disregard the sanctions from G7 EU. Somehow the Belgian government was not keen to have those sanctions because they knew that Belgium and Antwerp will suffer. But after those, they had a lot of pressure, especially  especially from the United States, from the EU, to implement those sanctions. Maybe from Rapportour, I can't remember. So definitely we have to accept it. It's a reduction of rough import of more than 30-40% because Belgium was a very important rough hop for Russia. But this reduction of rough hop of Belgium started already in 2023 before the sanctions.  because European banks refused to finance any transfer of money to Russia or to finance any invoices by Guggenheim, which was an American company, of Polish, of Russian transactions. So even before the sanctions, we knew that the war would have a strong, strong effect on our turnover, and this is what happened. Indeed, it happened, and we couldn't avoid it.  This is why the discussion was much more, how are we going to implement the sanctions? Much more than, do we have the sanctions or don't we have the sanctions? So again, on the rough business that has had and has still a strong impact, the only argument that we had always is, you have a sanction in Dubai, you don't have the sanction in India, you don't have the sanction. Israel, you don't have the sanction. You put us really in a inferiority position.  But we didn't have a choice. We are part of G7, we're part of EU. And also, people were very worried, once you put sanctions, when do you delete the sanctions? When do you take off the sanctions? Historically, sanctions, once they're here, they're here to stay. This is also quite worrisome for a long-term solution. That's a very interesting point. For the listeners who aren't familiar with what the timeline was, and correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, obviously the war started in February 2022, but it took until the 1st of January 2024  until there were actually any EU sanctions on Russian diamonds. So that year and a half approximately, more than a year and a half, the fact that there were no official EU sanctions during that period, was that because the industry voluntarily stopped buying Russian diamonds or was it because, you know, lobbying the EU not to introduce them for the reasons that you explained it, because, you know, we'll just end up going to other markets like Dubai or a mixture of the two or some other reason? No, the reason that the sanction wasn't implemented was because the Belgian government felt that if sanction is  implemented, it will right away move to Dubai and India. So they felt that the sanction will not be on the Russian, it will be simply on Belgium. It proves the last six, seven months that this is what's happening. It's the only country that's in sanction is Belgium. But this was the decision. The reason that we have already before the sanction, a 50 or 80% reduction of rough import is due to what we mentioned before, banking refusing to pay. Second,  refusing to deal with companies who are dealing with Russian goods. So the pressure of the brands not to deal with Russian goods is even stronger than the pressure from G7. But finally, the Belgian government gave in to the US and started implementing the rough sanction from Russian goods since 2024.  they chose not to.  I mean, America's sanction implementation can be very tough and very strong. Why should we get involved? Maybe some people thought that it's also a little bit solution about what you're going to ask most probably, what's happening with the supply. Some people believe there's an oversupply. So maybe the sanctions somehow will solve the oversupply issue in the natural diamonds, maybe other miners thought so or other stakeholders. But basically, it was a voluntary decision  not to get involved indirectly in any American sanction, even when it's not paid in American currency.  we are only between our friends, so we can discuss about this concept. You know, in Shakespeare's play Hamlet, he notes a few times that the graveyard is all where there's no disputes and differences become meaningless. Here in Arturk, we like to say that we're not a graveyard. And how do you prove it? You see how many differences and disagreements you have. So let's go from the beginning of the G7 because I have a feeling that's why I was invited  to the podcast. In the beginning, the government felt the huge damage that they're causing to Belgium trade. Maybe the government wants to have a high trading with foreign countries. Maybe there's some trade balance that will become very much imbalanced. Then the prime minister, who lost now election, Decro, decided he wants to compensate Belgium. How can he compensate Belgium? He did not have a cash box. So he decided  that let's do it, let's convince the EU, let's convince the G7 that Belgium should be a single note, that all kind of rough for verification, if it's Russian or not, should be physically going through the diamond office here in Belgium. And his somewhere calculation was like this, the rough will come back. And Suadizar, everyone agreed with it.  He, the prime minister of the government, claimed even that President Massif of Botswana approved it. We were very suspicious right away how can it be that Botswana should approve it. We also believed also it went a little bit against the Kimberley concept and process. And I have to compliment again the KP now that they upgraded the KP that now mixed origin. You can mention the countries of origin. I think it's a huge, huge difference.  which would have been done a year ago, maybe we wouldn't have the whole disagreement and fights. Is that you can mention or you have to mention? I don't know if it's have to mention. I'm afraid it's only now can mention. And most probably they will fight that you have to mention. Josh, it's the journalists who should find this out because this little question is huge difference. The African countries were very, very shocked with the Antwerp position and it's starting already to feel a  certain uniform boycott against Belgium trade. Meanwhile, President David Gotlib from the AWC resigned. A smart move in hindsight. And I took his position, which might not have been such a smart move in hindsight. I felt very overwhelmed. From one side, I had the prime minister approaching Antwerp to be the gatekeepers from the world. I think he was before election. He believed this will help his election.  to  involved in this whole scheme, this whole concept that maybe if they would be involved, they would have approved it. You never know. But it was a single-handed decision. So I was trying to get Al Cook on the phone. I was sure he would refuse to speak with me. But he picked up the phone. He said, no problem. I'm coming now to Artweb for my Artweb clients. The beers clients will have a dinner. We'll meet, surprisingly.  I was invited, even if I'm a sideholder, but I was invited by the dinner too. I was convinced sitting by the dinner, this is a plot from the bears. They will put some poison in my plate and the whole single note story will be over. So while Al was speaking, I changed plates. You know, he survived. And to make a long story short, Al and Feriel tried to guide me out of this mess against the whole world.  the stakeholders, against African countries, against other sourcing. And I'm trying still now to straighten it, to correct a little bit this mishap with the approach, if we need to note, we should have a multiply note. Meanwhile, America and the White House gave some messages that they still believe in self-declaration. So here you had already the unity that's  you thought you have in the G7 EU and therefore Belgium was forced to take this single note approach started also to show some cracks. And basically that's why we are still today. We do not have yet clarity and maybe it has to do a lot with the elections coming up. Is it going to be Trump? Is it going to be Harris? And what will be their approach later? So we were able to extend the final  decision with six months. I think America wants to wait another 12 months till the implementation and to see how we go forward. But it was really a difficult policy, it was a difficult implementation, and that's where we are now. With yet not a full clarity, how are we going to go forward?  Is that right? True. Okay. Exactly. So instead of one carrot up that you need to have a self declaration here in Belgium too, it will go to zero 50. But the single note or you call it the traceability was postponed by six months. And I believe with missing some clarity, it will be postponed to another six months. Is there any indication yet of where those multiple nodes would be? It would make the most sense to have it in producer countries. Additional to artwork, it should be done in a  maybe South Africa, Botswana and Angola. They deserve it. It's their role. I think they can build up a mechanism. Maybe if Antwerp has to play a role, Definit will play a role to show how the EU or how the G7 expect to have this role. But Definit, those notes should be multiplied and should be done in other countries too.  The G7 itself is not a political entity that can make rules, it's just like a group of, like a club of countries. But the idea was that they would all end up having the same rules, I believe. How did it come about that that didn't happen? I think American England started saying that the rules are much more too invasive. They decided that the rules organized by Belgium is much more disruptive for non-sanctioned goods than for sanctioned goods. I remember when I had to speak in one of the AWC meetings,  I said I just got a few phone calls from some governments who are asking if they can join the sanction list because it's much easier to have sanctioned goods sold than non-sanctioned goods. They made it so bureaucratic, so complicated that America says stop, it's going to disrupt the whole trade. I remember I mentioned to an American official that it's going to cost for diamond dealers 3% more for this single note concept. He answered, I don't  to buy any store in America instead of paying $1,000 to pay $1,003. That's 3%. So you see, yeah, but our profit margin is 2%. So he didn't realize what means 3% to a trade. So it was done in such a disruptive, such an invasive way without the full knowledge of the diamond business done by EU bureaucratic personnel. This is the reason by when they started to analyze  The concept, they understood that it's not feasible. And that's how the crack in the G7 happened. And this is where we are today. And this is the most dangerous concept, that every country should have his own rules, his own policy. And every country will be able to confiscate goods if it doesn't go according to their policy. And we had problems with the Swiss. We had problems with the Germans, border, that some goods were confiscated because they were  They thought already that the single-notes were implemented and they were upset to find some rough in Germany coming through Lufthansa that didn't transit first in artwork, which was not at all necessary. In Switzerland, they confiscated some old watches with diamonds and there are certifications on the old goods diamonds. Where is the G7 certification? So there's a lot of confusion and we have to be careful not to slow down the whole business because of this. Again, a business of non-sanctioned goods.  I mentioned also in this AWC dinner that a very big brand from Paris called me up and he said, Izzy, I really don't understand how you will go in the future. The current Polish, I understand I will have the G7, but what's happening with my old stock? So my wife was in the back and she heard me speaking. She said, if this is the brand store from Paris, tell her I will come take the old stock. They shouldn't worry about the old stock.  It's a little joke, but it is and it was very confused. So it was implemented without a clear plan because we didn't have all the stakeholders on the table. If we would have all the stakeholders on the table in an open, transparent conversation for the benefit of the diamond business with big business people, with miners, this confusion and this collateral damage wouldn't have happened. Okay. Talking of confusion, maybe we could clear out one thing in what you said.  was the issue of the single node on a G7 level and also the single node on an EU level. And my understanding was that the Antwerp Diamond Office was in fact introduced as implemented as a single node for all goods entering the EU from a certain date. I think was that March the 1st? Maybe correct me if I'm wrong on that. But it never became a single node on a global on a G7 level. Is that right? Yes, but you have to listen. If it's not going to be on the G7 level, it will not happen. We're not going to have other  policies in America, Canada, England, and Switzerland, and then for Belgium and Netherlands. It just doesn't make sense. The EU has to be together, sit down with the G7, and find a unified and aligned themselves with the same concept and with the same implementation. We cannot permit the industry, and that's somehow my responsibility, if after the podcast the government doesn't kill me. If I'm still alive, it's my  policy to make sure it shouldn't have happened. I don't want to fragment the business even more.  not happen yet. And I don't think it will happen on the EU level. Okay. And also zooming into one other thing that came out during this whole process, which is in March, after the latest rules came in, there were a lot of reports of delays in Antwerp and goods were coming in that shouldn't have been supposedly shouldn't have been delayed were being delayed for more than the promised 24 hours. Are you able to just explain from the from the inside? What actually happened? How did all that come about? Confusing. The diamond office was definitely not ready for it. The diamond  office did not know even the right documentation. This part of the guilt is the EU. The EU gave the set of rules only the last minute. They published it the last minute to the Belgian government. The government gave it to us a few days after the story. So there was a lot of confusion. Everyone was afraid to take responsibility. It's much more paperwork, something about even self-declaration. The diamond office did not have enough people, enough experts to  to solve it. So it should not have happened. And it happened. And it's totally our fault. And it shows again, if you're not prepared enough, and if you take commitment without knowing how to implement everything, you have some damages. Some rough took two, three weeks. There are some mixed origins that the diamond office suddenly decided not to permit. Even mixed origins, if it was not Russian origin, was permissible. But again,  did not want to give some clear guidelines, what's happening with mixed KP. There are too many partners in this kind of concept, and a lot of partners really don't understand diamonds. And if you have to implement everything, and if you have to make sure not to be a disruptive element, it gets very, very complicated.  same way that some of the other hubs have become. It must still be the case though that the average Antwerp diamond dealer or diamond manufacturer has been affected by lab-grown. I mean, it's affected everyone. It definitely affected everyone. It affected the demand. So it's a substantial challenge that we have. I feel a certain correlation that the G7 and the lab-grown. I feel that when we had the lab-grown trouble and problem on the table should also have been more stakeholders involved to see how we avoid this  catastrophic consequences that we had. I don't think it's Bruce Cleaver himself alone. I'm making a lot of enemies. That should have decided that Lightbox is a good thing to support Lavgon. I believe that we should have sat all on the table and see how will it affect the business. The same thing happened like we mentioned before with the G7. When there is a game changer concept, we should all sit together and there are enough organizations  in the diamond world or too many organizations to sit together and see how can we solve this. It's clearly that the Lapgrown affected everyone's business. It's clearly that affected America more than Europe or than China. It's also clear that with the dropping price of Lapgrown, maybe finally we see its two products. What we said from beginning, that it's two products. One's natural diamond is for you.  wife and lab-grown is for your daughter. So nice words, but that's not how it worked out. With a 20% difference in price, you cannot say it's two products. It's the same product, but one product is cheaper than the other. With a 90% of price, what we have today, we can say it's two different products. I hear more and more that in China and India, they're testing lab-grown diamonds. The good news is they're starting right away with a product which is 90% cheaper.  So also I don't think that any confusion can happen. And I'm very, very somehow optimistic that the Lapground product, I just saw a beautiful Swarovski store on the Fifth Avenue will belong to Swarovski. And we will again regain the natural diamond segments fully without having the competition of Lapground. It can take one or two years, can take less, but I'm very optimistic.  Again, besides, if we would have understood the danger of it, I think we would have supported it much more with marketing money, the natural diamonds. If you understand the competition and the concept, I think natural, the producers and diamond test would have jointly put a much more overwhelming money aside to support it with advertisement. But if you not really understand the danger or you like to belittle the competition,  You're not ready for the game changer issue that's coming. This is what happened with Lapcom. So you're right, Antwerp is not a Lapcom zone. I was also always upset that the big certification houses decided to give certification on a Lapcom diamond similar to natural, gave some customers more confusion. Maybe we should have tried to avoid this also. But again, I believe that now we rather see the end of the problem than the beginning of the problem.  consumers voted with his feet with the economic situation as it is the average US consumer is just more likely to buy a lab-grown diamond than a natural diamond. The US consumer has skewed more towards lab-grown diamonds, primarily for economic reasons.  Salesman in the store was very much convinced with the profit margin who compared how much money he's going to make on the percent 18 percent on the 20 percent on the lab grown and how much meagre is his profit margin on the natural times But I'm sure that he will have to hide the air condition in the store Because he's going to start sweating when they come back with a lap grown diamonds for resale It's not going to happen the same accident with the natural time if I were a representative  lab-grown industry, I would respond by asking, don't natural diamonds also depreciate as soon as you take them out of the retail store?  time, even chance at diamond sooner or later will again go up. I wouldn't keep such huge inventory if I don't believe in it.  same thing to you, Josh. Why is it when someone has a surgery, whenever he's doing a full investigation, who is the doctor, who is the professor, how many years this professor and doctor has experience, when he's going on a plane, he's never going to check how long the pilot has an experience. What's the difference? He should be worried with the plane and the pilot too. The difference is a simple one. The pilot flies with you. We always felt that the  the bears is flying with us. The bears is the captain, is the pilot of the industry. Whenever there was a storm, they were amidst the storm. Whenever there was sunshine, they enjoyed the sunshine. So the partnership with the bears was really a golden partnership because it was of common interest. We felt the pilot is flying with us. If it's going to be a little bit windy, we shake with them. If it's going to be pleasant, we're pleasant with them.  So we never had to inquire about their intention, about their demand because we knew its common interest. Now, what can I tell them about the bears? I can only give one blessing. I hope they're not successful and they stay in Anglo-American. I believe Anglo-American understand the business very well, the bears too, and we feel much more secure that they have a long-term interest for the industry and we feel much more comfortable with it.  So let's see how it goes. But I said it to Al Cook already a few times, we are too comfortable with you to try to help you to sell the beers. Right. Although it does seem like it's pretty much a bad done decision that Anglo is not going to hold on to the beers and therefore that it's going to go somewhere. We don't know exactly where. Yeah, it can always go with the part of set partners. Also, I'm more interwoven with the business ethic and the business experience. It can go on the market, can go apart.  and  successful, we have to see really who will be the partners. So you think that the best option for the industry would be someone within the industry? It would be within the industry and within the mining industry, and that President Massisi should take a quite a strong stake in the bears because we trust that he should have an alienation with our policies. One of the concepts is that Anglo-American will stay as a miner partner. I think this will also have a quite a  positive influence.  time, in time like now of oversupply, much more comfortable without being afraid that someone else will sell the goods. In the past, the bears were able to spend huge budgets on advertisement because they were the only ones benefiting from natural diamonds. This currently doesn't happen. But I think again, let's be flexible. Every generation has its challenge and it's a different game now to be a siteholder.  But we, you know, there was a motor of old site holder, his name was Goldman. He said, it's so difficult to be a site holder, but it's so much harder not to be a site holder. It's quite challenging. Every generation is a beneficiation who came added to being a site. It's completely different. There's a price competition. And now, like you said, to be a site holder, when you know that the base is for sale is again game. But I believe if you  have a long-term vision, you can find always a certain advantage in support. Don't forget the regularity of the bears. Allocation is so suitable for our plants, so suitable for factories and so suitable for commitments. And we always know that the bears has a certain stability in pricing. Doesn't mean they're cheap. Means that they're stable in prices. So for any programs, what's our business model, it gives you a huge, huge advantage. And this still  significant to date. Right, interesting. And before we finish, I know that AWDC will be hosting the Facets 2024 conference in November in Antwerp. Can you tell us a little bit about that? What's going to be happening there? I know this is the third edition of this event, right? Yes, but it's very, very, very important. You know, there's a famous Talmudic question. When you say the pray for the dead, you're saying the God who made peace in the heaven should make peace here on the earth.  The question is in the heaven, why should you have to make peace? There is no war in the heaven. Souls can live peacefully. God doesn't have to do anything in the heaven. Here we have our own opinions. So one of the answers is that peace is not only peace, it's also harmony. Or say Shalom bim ramav, God who made heavenly harmony should do the same harmony here down. I think that one of the concepts of the facet is again to  have a certain harmony concept in the diamond industry. We hope to have the prime minister from Belgium. We have, I can't give you a sneaky preview, the speaker, one of the biggest mine. We're going to have African presidents here. So we're going to have all the important stakeholders. The concept is to discuss all important issues, the issues of banking, the issues of futures, the issue of lab ground. And we're also going to show to the G7, we hope to have  very important people from EU, higher commissioners from the EU, to show that Antwerp has a future. Antwerp has a united future. And it's not through a single note we have future. We have future because we all have interwoven fabrics of interest together and together we stand and stronger we stand. I believe very much that November is in Antwerp not the ideal month. It's always very rainy month. So when you come, Josh, don't  forget your umbrella. For sure. But inside, I hope it will be very sunny, full with hope, with ideas, with concept, with an optimistic future. I'm hoping to be there. And there's other stuff happening that week as well, right? There's the diamond, Antwerp diamond days as well. Who will be interwoven with the dinner of the facet, who will be presented as one entity, and with some panels and about possibility of discussing the problem who is not there  The problem is on the mind from every person. Everyone is worried. Let's be honest. People are worried. How does the future stand with this potential sales of the bills, with the lab grown, with the economic crisis, with China for the moment not buying dimes? Where are we standing? We hope to give a little glimmer of hope and honesty and understanding in those urgent messages and fights.  sure many others are as well. Thank you very much, Izzy. You've been extremely open and courteous and humorous, so I've really enjoyed speaking to you. That's my nature. I hope I wasn't too open, but this will see the reaction on the podcast if I'm still around. I trust you will be. Thank you very much, Izzy. Thank you very much for your time.
