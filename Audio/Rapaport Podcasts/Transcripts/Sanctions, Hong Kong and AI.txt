 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Avi Kravitz. Welcome to another episode of the Rappaport Diamond podcast. I'm Avi Kravitz and on this episode, Rappaport's news editor, Joshua Friedman and I catch up with our special editor in chief, Sonja Esther Soltani upon her return.  from maternity leave. We discussed the recent Hong Kong show, Russian sanctions, the ongoing negotiations between the beers and Botswana, the Tiffany Nike partnership, the rumors of an LVMH takeover of Cartier, the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the industry. And Joshua recalls some highlights from the young diameter's trip to India. There's a lot going on in the industry. Sonia takes the reins in hosting this episode as we round up all the important issues facing the trade at the moment.  So please enjoy this wide ranging conversation between our editorial team, that's Sonja, Joshua and myself.  Take the rain today. And of course, in the studio with us is also our news editor, Joshua Friedman. Hi, Joshua. Hi, Sonia. Hi, Avi. So today I'm going to do this episode. Like, what are the big things that I've missed? I've been away for six months. What did happen in the industry? Let's pretend I didn't check social media. I didn't check any of the great news that Rappaport team produce every single day. What are the big, big things that happened for you, Joshua? Well, lots of things happened. Russia happened. There's been a number of developments.  in the diamond trade, in the manufacturing, in the rough market. I think clearly the continued fallout from the war in Ukraine is the main thing that's occupying people's minds at the moment. That's the intensity has kind of risen in the last six months as the anniversary of the start of the conflict approached. And we're now in fact past that anniversary, but that's still the main thing that people are talking about. Yes, I think it's obviously a very sad anniversary. But I think the Russian sanctions have been keeping a lot of people busy in terms of writing and  I know you dedicated a few research reports to the situation in Russia. So can you give me a bit of an update? I'm sure I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea of you being off social media for six months, but let's put that to the side. I said, let's pretend. It's a tough ask even to pretend. And we've seen how wonderfully active you are on social media. But with the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the G7 nations got together and put  out a statement with regard to diamonds. Diamonds was a small portion of that statement, but basically stating the intention to apply additional measures on Russian diamonds. And the bottom line of that intention is, as far as we understand, is to introduce a traceability element to the sanctions. There's still questions about the current sanctions that the United States has on Russian diamonds. It basically focuses on direct imports from Russia, which would mean that you  aren't import rough diamonds essentially, but what about polished, what about goods that were bought from El Rosa, taken to a trading center or manufacturing center such as India, Israel, Antwerp, wherever it is, and manufactured into polished. And then those goods are, the understanding is that those goods have a new source of being that trading center. So there is that sort of loophole of what they call substantial transformation that those goods would be allowed to be brought into the United States.  G7 group of nations have got together to try and circumvent that loophole. And I think there are two elements that are significant there. The first being that it's not just the United States, it's this broader group of countries that are working on those measures. And that would include by default, I think, the European Union, which is significant because of Antwerp's position in the diamond market and is a major importer of rough goods. And the second element is how do you deal with polished?  prevent polished with that is that has Russian origin, but is has gone through this journey and this this trip going through various trading senses. And so that brings a traceability element to it. And so there's this sort of urgency to apply source verification in the market. And that's very significant. It's been in the works, as you know, Sonia, it's been in the works for a long time with various elements, not just diamonds affected by geopolitical issues, but also incorporating  sustainability, ESG elements, that's environmental, social governance elements. And so this is really bringing it into regulation that sort of compels companies to apply it in those countries. So it's pretty significant. And I think in the long term, a positive move for the industry. So that's great because we know we've been talking, as you say, about traceability for a long time. So that's very sad circumstances that led to maybe something positive in the long term. And Joshua told me, how is it affecting the sentiment in a  market.  another factor that's contributed to uncertainty. I think what's on people's minds is the sort of bifurcation of the market, of the supply chain, that you'll have these goods that demonstrate that traceability element and has a verified source and those that don't, or those that demonstrate a source that's not necessarily kosher, that's not from a responsible source. And so it kind of puts in the air where each company is positioning itself within those two streams. I think very  black and white. I think that's just the way my mind works. And so either you're in that stream, in stream A or stream B. And I think this discussion is forcing businesses to sort of make that choice. And so it's very interesting, but as Joshua, you mentioned, it sort of injects a bit of uncertainty because it's not clear how it's going to work yet. These measures are not yet in place and it'll take a month or two before they are implemented. And so the discussions that are underway at the moment is exactly that. What is this  world look like where it's required that imports have that traceability elements to it.  an interesting and unusual task trying to pretend to all the readers that have been at the show by speaking to as many people as possible. Now they will know the truth. That's the Rappaport thing. We are fully transparent. I mean, the sentiment of the show was generally positive. Most people I spoke to, in fact everyone I spoke to said that there were huge numbers of people there. It was obviously the first time in two or three years that many people from around Asia and further away were able to come to Hong Kong for the show. As a recap, it's basically two main shows  in the year in Hong Kong. The two main jewelry shows are the March show and the September show. The September show is usually the bigger one because it's right before the holidays. But the March show is also important and tends to attract international buyers. And another thing that sort of contributed to the height of traffic at the show was usually it takes place over two venues in two different parts of Hong Kong. On this occasion, it was just at one venue in Wan Chai district in central Hong Kong. And so it was just more intense, more packed. But a number of people I spoke to said that although it was very busy, the actual conversion  sales was a bit mixed. Some people had good sales, some people didn't, and it really depended on how much they were willing to reduce their prices, and they seemed to apply to diamonds, but also to other areas of the jewelry market. So people were overall happy with the sentiment and the fact that China was reopening. This is an important show for the Hong Kong market because the main source of buyers are Chinese retailers, Chinese manufacturers who come to the Hong Kong show to buy diamonds, to buy jewelry. And they definitely gave the indication that they were buying again for investment  in preparation for selling to the Chinese consumer market, which has been very quiet for the last several months because of COVID and because of lockdowns. So sales were a little bit slow. Joshua, you spoke to quite a few diamond dealers that were at the show. I just wonder if the cautious environment for transactions was a diamond thing or if there was other elements of the market that maybe were, you know, color gemstones, finished jewelry, watches. I actually, I follow a watch guy on TikTok.  He has a wonderful account. His name is John Buckley. And he shows his negotiations with other dealers in buying and selling these sort of high-end secondhand watches. It's really fascinating. But in the last clip that I saw of his, he actually mentioned the Hong Kong show with an older, well-established New York dealer. And they both said that they heard like really good things from Hong Kong and they kind of expressed regret that they weren't there. And so I'm just wondering, firstly, if that was a diamond specific thing. I know that in your research,  you focused on the diamond market. And secondly, for me, the main takeaway from the Hong Kong show was that it was busy, regardless of orders, as just people were happy to be back and a kind of the fact that people were there, Chinese buyers in particular sort of gave us this indication that there's this pent up demand that's waiting to be released in China after all the COVID lockdowns. And so I think that's a source of optimism for the industry. I agree. I agree. There was actually a symbolic fact that the  The first of March, which was the first day of the show coincided with the day that Hong Kong lifted its mask mandate. And a lot of people said that it made it feel very much like a post-COVID show. The sentiment definitely was that even if Chinese consumers weren't spending in large amounts now, the recovery was on the way and in the next couple of months they would be. Sonja, that's the other thing that happened in the last six months. Six months that you were away, China was very much under lockdown and that really affected the market in a big way. You know, that you had this caution in the United States and this lockdown  in China that it's difficult to believe that there were still these COVID related restrictions there until January. And so the market was very quiet in that part of the world and now it's opening up. And I think while there is still caution in the global trade that Far East region is suddenly a source of positivity in the industry. Thanks both for giving me clarity about what's happening from Russia to China. Now, you know, I like my gossips. That's something that the team knows. I like gossip.  Finance and economy.  It's actually a Swiss paper.  It's very likely to the Bernard Arnault CEO and chairman of LVMH wants to buy Cartier. I'd also like to buy Cartier. I would just like to be able to buy one piece of jewelry from Cartier. I mean, it's the market leader in high-end jewelry. He'd understand why he'd want to. I would have just one request though, if they ever do the LVMH. If you do a collaboration between Cartier and Nike, just try to be a tiny bit more creative. I'm just going to put it out there because that would be a great way to do it.  was a big, big disappointment when you have two big brands getting together and that's all you get. So for people who really have been living under a rock for the past six months, there's been a collaboration between Tiffany and Nike. They released a limited edition collection of sneakers, you said, the Americans trainers. And I was extremely disappointed. I thought that was just a bit, oh, okay, whatever. What were you disappointed in? The design of the shoe? The design of the shoe. I think that's cool that  super brands get together. Why not? You know, I think that creates a burst. I think the marketing campaign around it was really exciting. And the Tiffany blue against the black actually was, I quite liked it. Oh, I like, I like the fact that we have a bit of dissent on this. I wasn't mad about the design of the actual shoe. The shoe seemed fairly plain. I think they could have done something. I agree with you, something more interesting, more sporty maybe. But I liked the contour. I liked the Tiffany blue on the swoosh. I don't know what else they could have done, Sonja. I don't know. Well, there was actually an  I think we're only at the thinking stage of that. I don't know if there have been some kind of a change in the way that we're using the shoes.  sort of collections that have come out based on AI design. But I think that's definitely something we'll see this year with all the talk around the artificial intelligence. I think that's a fascinating topic. I'm interested to see, but a lot of people have spoken to, especially designers. We're talking about designers who work at a bunch. We're talking about people who use their hands, who use an artistic vision, who use something that is very personal. So I think this type of people found it a little bit puzzling. And if you want a real piece of jewelry,  a real piece of jewelry, more unique, personal, individual piece of jewelry because whatever will be created with AI is obviously a real piece of jewelry as well, ultimately. But so far what I've seen, you can create amazing designs, you can create something that looks like, wow, I love it. But remember, you've been seeing jewelry that's been created by the human minds and the human hands for a long, long time that has creative, that has wow. And you know, like someone has actually worked with his hand or her hands to create this piece of jewelry that makes the most of a beautiful gem.  that comes from the earth. There's a story to it. There's a vision. It's not like the computer didn't create it for you. So I think if you have talent, you know, there's something that I would say for anyone. If you have talent and vision, AI can be fun to help you with some research, to help you to push the boundaries, to take the imagination somewhere else, but it's not going to create talent and it's not going to create vision for you. It will just replicate something that you've put in a machine, you know. Well, I think the focus would be on that personal element in the same way that people who own jewelry  They relate the piece of jewelry to their own story. Part of that story, as you say, is the design and particularly as we see more sort of bespoke pieces and people really being more involved in their own design of the jewelry purchase. I think that maintaining that personal elements, it would be important, although maybe using AI for the consumer to get involved in the design might be an interesting angle as well. There are areas of the industry where I'm pretty sure AI will take off. For example,  diamond grading, elements of diamond manufacturing where the savings, the potential savings are great and the need for individuality is more limited. It will kick in in some areas. We're seeing it in our area of work with the introduction of chat GPT that, you know, suddenly the art or skill of journalism is under question, that there's so much information out there that AI can formulate an informative story about a particular topic. But I think our personalities can account for a lot more than AI can. Yes, thanks, Avi, for saving my life.  saving Joshua's, my and your job in one sentence. Killing it and saving it in the end. I think that, as I said, it's very, very interesting and exciting to look, but there's a lot of risk of plagiarism in terms of writing. There's things that you have been prepared that you can't account for the human nature, I think, in a lot of these things, in the human element. And the unexpected as well that comes, I think, you were in Munich recently for a show, the meetings that you have, everything, all the nature, all the personal  touch that we brought to our writing, to our research, to our reporting, I think, can't be taken into account. Yeah, I agree. And I think the industry is in such a fortunate position because the more that technology pushes us towards automation and towards AI driven, whatever it is, the more that society will crave and want that authentic personal touch. And the industry is fortunate in that it's sort of built for that. It's really well positioned to take advantage  of both streams, I think. And that's where the industry is really in an exciting position at the moment, because there is all this technological advancement, but that's only amplifying the need for authentic, beautifully written and told stories that the jewelry industry is built on really. I agree. And I think nothing beats the first-hand experience as well, meeting the people, going to the places, seeing the jewelry. I think Joshua had a wonderful trip to India actually a few weeks ago already. You were with the Young Diamonds.  Yes. That is something that you can't get on an AI. What, do you sure you experienced that? Not yet. So I went to Mumbai and Surat in India with, as you mentioned, Sonya, the Young Diamond Tears, which is an organization, as the name would suggest, for young people in the diamond and jewelry industry. About 50 of us went to visit several factories, several kind of design studios, two diamond bosses, and various other places in the industry. I learnt a lot about the different ways the industry  HK has a big staff.  They don't. They're remunerated strictly according to their performance. Some of them where it's a bit looser. So it's really very interesting to see how some of these places work. Particularly also, I'm hoping to write a little bit more about this, but the Surat Diamond Bourse is, as we speak, it's currently not populated yet. It's still waiting for companies to actually move in. But we did a tour of the Surat Diamond Bourse and saw how that's going to develop. Also did an in-depth kind of behind the scenes tour of the Bharat Diamond Bourse in Mumbai. Also got a few days just to meet with the industry, look at some diamonds.  touching diamonds, interview people, meet with people, get the on the record and off the record scoop. So yeah, it was a very, very productive time. What was the most fun part for you that you had on the trip? I think going to Surat for the first time actually. I loved the weather there. Mumbai as you know Avi is a little humid, a little stuffy. Surat is a much drier climate. That's obviously not, I mean, there's more to it than that. Trust the Brit to talk about the weather when you're asking what fun he had.  It's a very relaxed atmosphere there, extremely welcoming atmosphere and it really enables you to get a lot out of the trip and understand the culture quite well. It is fascinating the difference between Mumbai and Surat, both culturally and also the role that it plays in the industry. And I think what's going to be even more fascinating as the Surat Diamond Bulls has now been built and as you say, hasn't been occupied yet. It's a massive structure and it will require a lot of those Mumbai companies to shift  their trading operations and their distribution operations to Surat. And so the extent to which that will take place and how quickly it will take place is something that I think will change the nature of not only the industry in India, well, particularly in India, but I think it will have a ripple effect on the way the industry operates. So it's another sort of thing to look out for in the next year or two. I agree. I agree. And some will move, some won't. We'll see. So let's watch this space then.
