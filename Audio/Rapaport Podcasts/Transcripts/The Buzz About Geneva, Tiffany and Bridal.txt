 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Avi Kravitz.  We cover the glitz and glamour of the Tiffany store opening, the auction market ahead of the major Neva auctions, the Gem Geneva show, and some of the retail trends observed by Signatureless in its recent Invest Today with some quirky, fun and informative observations by the team. It's always fun and informative chatting with Sonja and Lea. I'm lucky enough to learn from them every day. I'm sure you'll gain a lot from this episode, so please enjoy our conversation.  Hello everyone, welcome to the Rap Before Diamond podcast. I'm Avi Kravitz, the Rap Before Diamond senior editor, emphasis on the word senior, I think. And with me today is our talented team. Firstly, Sonja Esther Soltani, our editor in chief. Welcome Sonja, so great to see you. I'm happy to be here, Avi. And also with us is Lea Marovitch, our senior news reporter. It's great to have you on the podcast again, Lea. Thanks for having me, great to be here. And it's been a while since we've done a team podcast.  and it seems I don't know it feels like the markets quiet but there's a lot happening and there's a lot of information that's coming our way. There have been a few big events I think within the greater jewelry industry. I think we'll get into a few of them. We're going to touch on the Tiffany store reopening after its renovation. There is the auctions coming up. There's the Jim Genevieve show that will touch on all these topics throughout our time together today. But I want to start with the Signet investor day that they held a few weeks ago where they gave  some interesting observations about the market, about the jewelry space and particularly in bridal. And so Sonia, they mentioned that they're expecting a boom in bridal, but at the moment it's quiet. There seems to be this pent up demand for bridal. So is that something that you're seeing and hearing from the retail space in general on the bridal market? It depends who you speak to. I think if you speak to the independent, they will tell you there's a lot of people getting custom work. It seems like more and more people are ordering  very specific rings with a lot of meaning, a lot of stories. So that's more like the independent designers. If you speak to them, they tell you it's going very well. I think Lea is more familiar maybe with the US retail market and what it means, but it seems like it's more people are getting maybe more interested in different type of pieces than what it's offered at Cygnet. I think from what we see, but it's because I speak to a lot of high-end designers and independent designers who love doing custom works and independent retailers as well.  I don't know where's the bridal market going. It seems like it's a bit in between between the people who didn't really plan their wedding yet, you know, because of COVID, because people are getting engaged to be later. I read an interesting statistics that more women are getting married after 40 this does 75% increase of women. So that gives, you know, hope for people to buy maybe a bigger ring because you waited for a bit longer. And there's hope for men over 40 to, to, to find that right one. Exactly. Exactly. I wouldn't say, but I think I was  talking about the ladies and they said, you know, the only problem is that there will be fewer old, you know, bigger anniversaries. Maybe it would be anniversaries will be a bit far in between because people get engaged between the age of 40 and 59. But I don't know. What did you say, Leah, for the most, you know, well-known retailers in America? Well, I was actually surprised that Signet said that engagement ring sales weren't going so well because a lot of the independent jewelers that I spoke to said they were going really well. There was a lot of engagement movement over COVID.  when people who were on lockdown together realized that they could live together happily. I think maybe part of the reason is because during COVID, people took a big liking to supporting their local and independent jewelers. So I think it's a possibility that maybe Signet suffered because of that. I think that Signet sort of mentioned that there's still this adjustment that the market is undergoing from COVID and that the delay in engagements was a result of that. And that's kind of opposite to what you're saying that it was  the experience among the independents. But I think there's both sides to the coin that are probably right. I think you're right that independents did see this. There may be two segments of the engagement ring marker, those couples who went into COVID together already and realized that they wanted to make that commitment. And then there was that little push after COVID that we saw that those commitments come to fruition. And then there was the sort of dearth in new relationships coming that were forming during those lockdowns.  difficult to date, it was difficult to meet people. And so it seems that Cignaz is reporting the effects of that right now. And maybe that we're starting to come out of that as we're moving further and further away from 2020, that people have now had a chance to meet and date and decide to commit together. And that's why they're expecting that, that bridal boom in the next, you know, I think from the end of this year and going into 2024. Does that make sense to you, Sonja?  mentioned something like, you know, they expect like, we have to wait for 2025, 2026 to really see a big boom because people will get back into this wedding marketplace. So there's something, and I think that was an interesting thing as well about the results. There are a lot of self purchasing women. I know that we talk about the bridal market as the biggest share of the business, but you know, obviously during COVID, a lot of women wanted to treat themselves. They were staying at home, they had more time. So I think that's also something to look at. And hopefully that will also influence what women buy  when they buy the engagement ring?  I know that Lea, you recently came back from a good family cruise, I think, right? I did, and we had a great time, and it was so happy and nice to be out after COVID, let me tell you. We went to the Caribbean, which was very nice. Amazing. Well, I think, and that's another aspect that's playing on the market right now, is that travel is back. And we see that in the ticket prices, in the bookings, that it's more difficult to find to get that good booking on the dates that you want. And so the industry is back to normality, I think.  that you have this experience economy coming back. And I think, Sonja, the challenge for jewelry retailers is to bring that experience into the store now, right? And we're seeing some interesting things, I think, among retailers as they try to up their game within the physical location. Yes, absolutely. I think a lot of them are trying to create this experiential shopping for their customers. Are we thinking of Tiffany? We are thinking of Tiffany. I was trying to say that.  and I think I did it. It's a nice one because obviously Tiffany is the one that created one of the most classic well-known engagement ring setting ever in the world with a six prong. So there's something to say about engagement as well. And it's still one of the, I think one of this iconic scene, the girl gets to Tiffany to receive engagement ring. So the engagement ring floor is still a landmark. Don't call it a flagship, by the way, this is the landmark. It just reopened after four years of renovations.  Renovations didn't start by LVMH. I saw a lot of people saying, oh, it's very French, but actually that's not true. It was started by the company before they were bought by LVMH. And they worked with a New York architect and there's a very nice feel about it. I think it just looks amazing. It's beautiful. It's elegant. It has this different floors, different experience, the history of Tiffany, the high injury, the silver floor, silver being the core of Tiffany, Tiffany's business, but upgraded. And they had a massive party.  I think they partied for two days when they opened it at the end of April. They had the Gal Gadot, who's the ambassador of cutting the ribbon. And they had a lot, a lot of celebrities, K-pop star Jimin that has, you know, when you post a picture of him wearing Tiffany jewelry, 7 million likes on Instagram. So I think they, they created a really nice buzz about it. Yeah. I mean, uh, the opening certainly, even for someone who never in their wildest dreams would expect an invitation to such a party, there was a sense of FOMO because  did a really great job on social media as well, really hyping up the store. And I was thinking about that aspect of being an LVMH project and that the renovation began before the acquisition of Tiffany and the sort of that transition from an American iconic to being within a French brand. But I think, Lea, I don't know what you think, but it feels like LVMH, especially with this reopening, has maintained that sort of American brand feel  about Tiffany that it's always kind of had and any concerns about of it losing its density and as such would have kind of dissipated. You know, I actually think that they did a very good job moderating between the two. I think it still retains the American touch, but I think it also has that European chic to it that just gives it a little bit of an extra edge. So I think the new name, the landmark, designates it as a destination. A landmark is a destination, a place to go.  Boy was it the place to go and I think it actually with all the artwork and the way that they've done at the spiral staircase is a piece of art in itself it's a little bit like cross between a museum and a jewelry store and People came out and forced to see it. I think they were excited The renovation was supposed to be done in two years But because of kovat it took four and I think people were really waiting for it to happen to get out to see it and to enjoy it And and it seems also that we talk about the diamond market. We talk about the diamond trade  and that it's been quiet for some time since the beginning of the year, but the brands still seem to be doing well and there's still some optimism, particularly on the high end. And that's raised some anticipation for the coming events in Europe, in Geneva in particular with the Sotheby's and Christie's auctions coming up and the James Geneva show as well, which has gained some prominence, I think, in the last year or two in the trades calendar. And Sonja, so you're gonna be  I went two years ago, I think November edition. One year they did, it was 2021. I've been loving James Genève from the first edition, the inaugural one that went to in 2018, that one I remember, because suddenly under the same roof, you could see gemstones, diamonds, A-State jewelry of the highest level, young designers, up and coming designers, labs, museums, everyone under the same roof. And then I went to the first edition, and I went to the second edition,  and what's very beautiful about it is that they tried to keep it small. They wanted something intimate. They didn't want something like basal wall that is so big that the exhibitors feel lost and not looked after. So I think that's the success really of Thomas Farber and Ronny Tota, the co-founders, that they wanted the exhibitors to feel really special. So they don't accept so many people. There's a waiting list. It's a bit like Chanel or Hermès. You can afford it, but you can't have it. So this year, I think they over have 210 exhibitors.  I spoke to very high end diamond dealers who told me they would have loved to be there, but they were told, no, sorry, we don't want to grow so big. So it's going to be, I think, a very interesting show. I think keeping in the spirit of the show that everybody can speak to each other to keep it intimate, but at the same time, where solid business and serious business is being made. And there was that gap within the European sort of higher end when Baselworld closed its doors and there was that opportunity for a show to take its place.  Basel was always a big watch show essentially and I think that was part of the challenge for the diamond and the jewelry trade that was kind of in the shadows of the massive watch exhibition that took place at Basel. But James Genève seems to have cemented itself as filling that gap and I think they've had a very clear and interesting and effective strategy to achieve that by keeping it sort of in demand and limiting the supply of exhibitors and that also makes it more  more worthwhile for the exhibitors that do attend. But it'll be an interesting show this year, I think also because Gengenev is famously timed around the auctions that take place in Geneva in May, the magnificent Jules Auctions of Sotheby's and Christie's. And there's some mixed expectations, I think, this year for the auctions, right? There's some beautiful pieces coming up in some collections as well. But the auction season  off to a bit of a mixed start, let's say.  to sell almost 25 million and I don't know what happened to it actually. I checked in with Sotheby's and I got no answer but it was one of about seven pieces that were over five million that were their top pieces that didn't sell. I think though the expectation is still good with the Geneva sale especially Christie's because they'll be featuring the Heidi Horton collection which is supposed to be one of the most valuable collections by a single  collector ever valued at over 150 million and Sonya will be at that auction so I'm a little jealous but only part one if it can help maybe I won't I won't see the sunrise ruby being you know with the gavel like this that's it sold it will be I think on a day after I leave Geneva but uh yeah so she mentioned the sunrise ruby actually sold in 2015 Sotheby's sold it in 2015 and it made a record 30 mil over 30 million so it will be interesting to see if lightning  and straight to us.  of pieces that didn't sell or we don't know if they sold or not. They just didn't appear in the results, right? So that could lead to one of many assumptions of what happened to them. Either they sold privately or they didn't sell at all. They were withdrawn. But certainly the Sotheby's didn't get back to you on your questions has added to the mystery at least. It has. So there's obviously a bunch of different things that could have happened to those jewels. There was a whole bunch of them. So it was surprising that there was so many,  assumption is is that if they sold privately or you know something else of that nature that they would have been happy to let us know that they sold privately. So the fact that I not only emailed but I also called they said they'd get back to me and I never heard back and I tried again and they did not answer my calls leads me to believe that they probably didn't sell and they're trying to not highlight that fact. And it's sad because those were some really beautiful pieces that were within the expectations of the  pre-sale expectations, they were among the higher valued pieces in that offering. Yes, they were. They were the top five or six pieces. Okay. Well, Sotheby's, if you're listening, you still got time to get back to us. We are watching with interest and we're watching with interest the Geneva sales coming up as well. You excited, Sonia? You don't say. It's like everything. It's like a candy store. You know, you have J'aime Genève, you have Sotheby's, Christie's, Philippe's previews.  meeting my friends, going out with, you know, I'm part of women's association called the Glitterati. They have their big event in Geneva during that time. Meeting our colleague from Altrop who's coming for a day. Leah Ritter, who's also a head of sustainability here. So we're going to go around and check some nice stones, I think. Sounds like a lot of fun. And I speak on behalf of Leah and myself when I say we're completely jealous of your... Yeah, so she's rubbing it in here, all the nice stuff she has to do. We are pushing her. So before we wrap up,  Maybe let's have a think towards the next few months. Sonia, you're going to Gemgenov. So apart from Gemgenov and the auctions, what's on your radar for the second half of the year, let's say? Well, we're talking about shows, I think. I really want to see what's happening in Vegas, that you're going and I'm not going and they are. So we're staying home together. So what's happening in Vegas? You know, what is going to sell? What is going to be the the floor activity? What is going to be trending?  At Vegas being the JCK show, but also the Couture show, obviously more independent high-endurers. Are the retailers excited about the second half? Are they going to stall, buy things for the holiday season? Because by June, we're already talking about what's happening at the end of the year. I'm really interested in the trends and also what is going to be on buyers' minds after Vegas. I think that's a really good reflection of where the market is going. There's a lot of speculation about what is influencing the slowdown  the wholesale market in the dealer market and I think there is some expectation that Vegas will give us a better idea of what's happening at least in the US market which is really sets the tone for the rest of the industry and what about you Lea? Is there anything any news story or industry events or personal events maybe that's on your mind? Well right now all I can think of is my move next week so can I say that she stole my answer I was actually looking forward also to the JCK shows to see what's going on  there and what's selling. Looking forward to the upcoming Geneva New York auctions and really to see what happens in the bridal market, I think. Yeah, I think the bridal as signet really set the scene for or lay the seeds for the rest of the industry to really keep an eye on what's happening in that bridal market. And I think you're right. I think that might be the sort of make or break for the nut break. I think the industry will be fine, but it'll set the tone at least for the industry for the rest of the year.  ស្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្្  been ongoing talks for the last two, three years since COVID that those talks have been extended. And there's a lot at stake that we're keeping an eye out on the makeup of the rough markets and how the beers operates in Botswana. Botswana being such an important center for the industry. And then of course, later in May, the G7 nations are reviewing their sanctions program on Russian goods. And there's this talk about introducing clauses to bring in sort of traceability  to the imports of goods to the G7 countries and that'll have a big impact on the industry. So there are those two sort of announcements that are at the back of my mind or at the front of my mind at least that I think are going to have a lasting impact on the industry. So it seems like the trade is quiet but there's a lot going on behind the scenes that is influencing the market. Absolutely and I think there's something that's not behind the scene. Avi always has a joke that I'm doing shameless promotion for Rappaport and Rappaport team but here I'm going to be  be not shameful at all to say that we won an award for Editorial Excellence in Business Media is the Neil Awards and it's because of our coverage of the Russian sanctions and the Russian-Ukraine conflict and how it has impacted on diamonds. It's a team effort and it's also a multimedia approach. In a package there was an analysis, a written analysis on wrapperpull.com, there was a webinar. And the club includes everything that we do as well to keep a pace with the industry and the development. So I think there's some  very proud of the whole team. I just wanted to say it. And if you want to follow everything that we've done, you can go on wrapupport.com and ongoing developments, obviously, Botswana, G7, everything that's happening, you can read on wrapupport.com. I don't write news, so I'm really here clapping for the wonderful team we have. So I'm looking forward to more awards. That's it. That's where you lay, Navey, for the rest of the year. I'm glad you brought it up, Sonia. It slipped my mind. Maybe it's because of all those awards  that I've won, I'm kind of used to it. Full disclosure, this was the first that I've been involved in. So I'm also very proud of the team. And the thing about it is that it's an ongoing story. As we mentioned, it was really our coverage at the beginning of the conflict and the various analyses that we did. But this story just keeps on influencing the market. So we're keeping a close eye on things. So thank you for joining us, Lea. It's been an interesting discussion as always. And Lea, we're going to keep an eye on those auctions.  Thanks for joining us. Thank you, Sonja, and safe travels to Geneva. We're looking forward to your reports. Well, now they're not going to be stuck at the airport because they didn't take a COVID test, which happened last time. I almost didn't fly back, so I'm happy to be traveling post-COVID.
