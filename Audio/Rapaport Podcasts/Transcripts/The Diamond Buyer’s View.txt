 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Joshua Friedman.  and the COVID pandemic and how the current downturn in the diamond market has created an opportunity. He also spoke about his regular trips to India to buy diamonds and his visit to a diamond mine in South Africa. Enjoy the episode.  Thank you so much and just know that my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Israel during this time. Lee Michaels started over 45 years ago with a dream that my mom and dad had to own their own business and have their own jewelry store. My dad was working for Zelle Corporation. He was the head buyer for all of Zelle Corporation and decided that he wanted to have something of his own and build a company. And so my mom and dad searched for about two years while he was working part time.  time trying to find a business to buy ended up starting a business in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at Cortana Mall. And from there, we've been able to grow to 10 stores throughout four states. And it's been quite a journey. It's been a lot of fun. My brothers and I now are in the business working alongside with our father. And we have a great opportunity in this business to continue to celebrate with our customers. And we're very excited about the future. Lee Michaels is your father and then it's the three brothers, correct? We're working together.  What's it like working with brothers?  when we're aligned on the goals, it's pretty impossible to stop us. But when we're not aligned, that's when you need to take the time, make sure that you kind of figure out where you want to go and make sure that you have everyone aligned on that. I will say that the outcomes become better with three heads than one. You're able to think through things. And the fact of the matter is my brothers and I have such different personalities that it lends itself to making a better decision. Because I may be looking at it analytically, one of my brothers may be looking at it emotionally,  And one of my brothers may be looking at it objectively. And so when you come together with all three points of view, that's probably going to be the best decision. So do you actually literally take a vote at the three of you on strategic decisions? So typically we don't have to take a vote. We can come to consensus and we talk through the issues and get aligned on the issues. That's only if we have to. We have at least two times a week Zoom calls with our chief administrative officer, our father and the three of us.  to talk about what's going on in the business and focus on strategy for the business. Right. So a lot of people listening to this will be from a family jewelry business, but I'm not one of them. So if you could maybe tell what's it like growing up in and around the jewelry store. So growing up in and around the jewelry store is that the family focuses on the business and you're always talking. I mean, if we wanted to see our father growing up, because obviously he was a first generation, started the business, worked in it. If you wanted to see him, you came up to the business.  Right. As you've mentioned, you have stores across various states within Southwest USA. How do you manage, I mean, it's not unique, but how do you manage to manage such a large, relatively large chain of stores? Well, one thing we're fortunate is that there's three of us and we're all GMOs. So, we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all GMOs. And we're all  geographically in different places. So we're not in one corporate office in Baton Rouge. We're spread out. So my younger brother Chad is in New Orleans and he oversees that market with other markets and my older brother Ryan is in San Antonio. He oversees that market with other markets as well. So we've kind of divided geographically. But beyond that, it's really not about us. It's about our people. It's about making sure that you have a culture of great people that really care about the customers, care about the  experience, making sure that we're delivering on our core values every day. So how many non-family members of staff do you have in the business? We have around 170. Right. How do you manage that combination of being a family business, but also having relatively large staff? Well, it's like our father said, we need to never forget that we're a mom and pop and little things matter. So you need to focus on the details, but you also have to have that vision, strategy and buy in of  employees and making sure that they understand what is our vision, where are we going and how do we align together to make that accomplish the goals. And, you know, we've started strategic planning at least every three years and then we come back to it and talk about, OK, where are we in the planning process? Did we achieve the goals that we set out for last year? And every year with our managers, we have a goal setting sessions that we align with that. Then it goes back to the stores and the stores set their goals  to align around the goals of the management team.  and get a gift for $100 for our graduation, you can also get a gift for a 50th anniversary. And what happens also is during Christmas, we get pictures from our customers with 15 Lee Michaels boxes around the tree in that red and black, and it's almost free advertising. So it works really well. Whatever you sold for a million dollars. That I would not be able to say. No problem. It has something to do with what Repnet does. Okay. How much of your business is engagement rings?  I would say around 20% of our business is engagement rings. It's probably a little lower today after the advent of man-made diamonds into the marketplace. So let's talk a little bit about that. You have made public statements. You don't sell lab-grown diamonds. You've said why, but maybe if you could just recap for the audience, why do you not sell lab-grown diamonds? Well, number one, we don't believe in how the majority of people are selling them, and we would choose not to sell them in the way they're being sold, which is on a color and clarity  scale that indicates rarity. That's the whole purpose of the color and clarity scale was is to discern what was rare and what was not rare. And when you have something that can be made just like a widget every time, how can we sell that on a scale that indicates rarity? So we actually have no problem with people selling lab grown diamonds in a fashion of what they are, which is not rare and using a traditional markup that makes sense.  And what I've been told by a lot of people is, oh, I've made so much money selling lab-grown diamonds throughout the years. It's been the greatest thing we've ever done. We make more money selling lab-grown than natural diamonds. Well, is that, are we doing right by our consumers by doing that? And when I say making more money, they're making more money per transaction, not because they're selling more transactions. So the average ticket has gone down, but the average gross profit dollars per transaction has gone up.  And so are they making a fair markup on the customer? And we've chosen not to do that. Our core values say that we will not make short-term gains for our long-term future and short-term profits for our long-term future. And we believe that we need to stay the course in selling natural diamonds on rarity and especially engagement rings and that we can stand behind, sleep at night and make sure that we're doing the right things by our customers. And we do believe  that there will either be two things that will happen. One is that the natural diamond dream dies and nobody wants a natural diamond because everyone can have a lab grown diamond, in which case diamonds die. Okay. Or there becomes a settling in the market and lab grown diamonds get sold based upon what their value is, which is a fair markup over what it costs to produce. And they get sold as maybe not so much an alternative to a natural, but a new category. And if that happens, I think that would be a great  It's a great thing for the industry. It allows a lot of people that may not have been able to get a natural diamond to get a lab-grown diamond. But it's not using the horror of a natural diamond to sell something that is not a natural diamond and is not rare and being able to do that and make more profit on it. And that just doesn't seem to be a scenario that seems right for the customer. Do you have customers come into your stores and ask for lab-grown diamonds? Yes. And we actually recommend that they go to Walmart  Walmart actually has the best pricing on lab grown diamonds and a fair Marco. All right. By the way, you have a very good YouTube page. I enjoyed doing a bit of research there. Thank you. And I noticed in one of your videos, you say there may eventually be a place for lab grown diamonds in your stores. So what would have to change in the market for your science to change? I think what Pandora is doing is phenomenal. I mean, they're selling a product of lab grown diamonds as a fashion accessory piece that doesn't really hold value.  That's perfect. I think that's a perfect place for lab-grown diamonds. I think lab-grown diamonds are interesting when you use them to do things that you couldn't do with natural diamonds, like making maybe a dial of a watch out of a lab-grown diamond. So there are places where I think lab-grown diamonds really can thrive. It's just not as, hey, do you want something double as big for half the price? I mean, that doesn't seem to make as much sense as, hey, look,  this really, I want a piece of travel jewelry. I'm not really looking for to buy something in 18 karat gold. I'm okay if it's Vermeer, you know, and I'd love, you know, some lab grown diamonds in it. And I want it to look nice. I think that's a, that's a great place in fashion jewelry. Did you think it could be taking some of that $100 range that you spoke about before the graduation gift, that sort of thing? Do you think that's an area that could be taken by lab grown in the future? It certainly could potentially, and I think that would be a place for it. But like I've  I don't think we're there yet because it seems as if the manufacturing and wholesaling community wants to go at the highest rate of return for them, which is trying to offset and sell bridal diamonds or large pieces so that they can capture the most value at first. So until that changes and you see more people like Pandora doing things that make sense in the industry for us, then I think we would see a place where it could be very compelling.  Right. You said before, if I understood you correctly, that the proportion of your total business that comes from engagement rings has decreased. And that's because Lab Grown has cut into your business in that segment? I would certainly say that it is because retailers have decided to embrace the Lab Grown and sell it as an alternative to natural. Yes, and it has had an effect. I will say this, though. I don't think there's been any great marketing campaign out there that's really driven Lab Grown.  I think it's been this unfortunate profits that people are trying to get from selling them. And so it's happening at the retail point of sale, not from all this demand being driven up by some great marketing campaign, by some genius saying, hey, I figured out this really new, innovative way to capture new consumers by lab room. No, it's just been a situation where people have gone to the incentive, which the incentive is profit, and said, hey, at point of sale,  I can make more and it's easier for me to transfer someone to a lab-grown diamond than it is to sell a natural.  our experience throughout the whole store. We now are providing a better experience for our customers because of the brands like Rolex and Patek have helped us to elevate and make sure that we're not just looking at a sale, but we're looking at a relationship and keeping the dream alive for our customers. And what it does is instead of just saying, hey, there's a transaction that may happen. No, there's a relationship that's going to happen over time and the experience that customer gets and  wanting to come back in our stores time and time again, even if they're not buying something, that's incredibly valuable. And it's something that we've been able to take and use throughout our business other than just the watch brands. Do you make money on Rolex and Patek sales? Or is it something that's more about getting people into your store? I would say that the watch business is a very healthy business at Lee Michaels. OK. Can you tell me a bit about how you how you market your stores to and your jewelry to consumers? What's your strategy? I would say this.  The best person to speak on this was my brother Chad who oversees our marketing, but I can speak to it in ways having grown up in the business and everything else. We take multiple approaches. We want to be relevant in multiple areas, whether that be social media, whether that be traditional media, even paper. We're still in paper billboards and making sure that in our communities that we are, we want to be first choice in all of our communities. That's kind of one of our vision statements and first choice. When you think of  jewelry or you think of a gift, you think of Lee Michaels. Now, when you say that, then how do you build a marketing campaign around that so that when someone thinks that they're going to celebrate, they want to come to Lee Michaels. And that's what we've really done. And one of the things that I've loved the most with Chad and the marketing team have done is some of the animated videos that we've been able to do on TV that really show a different side of our brand, I think, and make us more approachable, but yet still sophisticated in a way.  for  in front of your consumers. And talking of downturns, how did your stores perform during the first COVID crisis and then during the post COVID boom in 2021, 2022? How would OGC view? So Josh, I'm going to start back further than that. So you kind of get an idea of Lee Michaels and what we've been through. So number one, having our father, a founder who had his back against the wall from day one in the company, it's been invaluable  during tough times. And we learned first through Katrina. Katrina, we had two stores in New Orleans that went down. We had other stores that were down because our network wasn't up that was out of Baton Rouge. We scramble. We had to figure out how to be nimble. And it started with one thing in mind first, our people. How do you take care of your people first? Are they safe? Are they where they have food, clothes, housing? If we take care of our people,  care of them, we can do anything because you can rebuild a jewelry store. You can restock it with merchandise. But if you don't have people that have passion and desire to want to be with you, you don't have anything. So we have been firm believers that take the people approach first. So during Katrina, it was about housing. It was about repairing. It was about we set up a foundation that some of our great partners were able to contribute to, and we were able to give back to our employees to make them whole.  Let's fast forward to the next occasion, which is the financial crisis. So seven, oh eight, same thing. People in mind first, no layoffs. We're not going to do layoffs. We're going to figure this out. We knew going into it because we were going towards Christmas. The number one thing was, is that we had to make sure that we sold as much product as we could so that we had as much cash as we could coming out of it. And so we were extremely focused on making sure that we had a good Christmas and knowing that come January we can reassess and figure out what to do.  but step number one is keep your people. If we have our people, we can make it work. Now we go into COVID. So COVID happens, we get shut down. I want to say it's April. We start doing cashflow statements that figure out what are our burn rates? How are we going to stay in business for at least three months? This was before any PPP money. And then the first step was the family all took two thirds of our pay and took a haircut so that we could continue to pay our people. I think at most our people had a 10%  reduction that then got paid back to them after we figured out that we were getting the PPP loans and everything else. But step number one was how do we cut ourselves so that we can make sure that we keep our people? And that's been our foundation. And through that, we are still seeing gains post-COVID in our business. We've been very, very fortunate that we've been able to build. We were in the middle of building one store, remodeling a store during COVID that opened back up and  Since then, we built a new store in New Orleans that we moved from the mall outside the mall. We built a brand new store in San Antonio in the quarry, and we remodeled a store which was a full renovation in our other mall in San Antonio in La Contera. And it's just been phenomenal. And I have to say, my brother Ryan, who oversees our construction, has done just an amazing job with the new build outs. The way the look and feel of our stores today, and you were asking me  about our brand partners such as Rolex or Patek and they've really, Rolex has helped us tremendously rethink how we look at our stores. How do we do side-by-side selling? How do we make sure that we make it a more luxurious experience, but also cater after the customer and make sure that it can be a destination where they want to come and hang out with us? I know a lot of people in the industry describe 2021, 2022 as the best years that they can remember. End of 2021, 2022 was the best one of the  How are those years for you? Justin, we're still growing. So I can't say that those were our best years. Our best years still seem to be ahead of us. Don't know how long that will last, but we have not seen a slowdown since COVID. And so how are things looking now? How would you describe consumer demand at the moment? So I would describe the consumer as somewhat bifurcated in the sense that the high end is still doing very well. I think the people that are in the middle range are a little more hesitant than they have been in the past.  And you have to work a little harder today to make the same sales and to grow. So it's not quite as easy as it was, but I think that hard work keeps you sharp. Sometimes when it becomes so easy, are you really reinvesting? Are you really doing the things that are going to take you to the next level versus when it's a little more challenging to get the same growth? Then you're working at it saying, okay, how do I start outbounding more? How do I start reaching out to the customer if they're not coming in quite as often? What are the things I need to be doing as a  company or we need to be doing as a company to make sure that we're going out to them, that we're making sure that we're still top of mind with them. Right. If that's the case that higher end is still spending, how is that impacting the types of diamonds, the sizes, colors, clarity of diamonds that you're selling? So for the most part, we are still selling from one carat up to probably, I would say seven to eight carats, fairly, you know, steady. What's been interesting though, and this is more of a situation of the  market, we're able to upgrade the quality of our diamonds for the consumer and they are paying less based upon where the market is today. The market is the most buyer friendly market that's ever existed for natural diamonds. And when I say buyer friendly, it goes from us as buyers in the market in India to our customers buying in our stores. You know, it may have been that we would have sold something that has strong blue fluorescence to hit a price point before. Now we could do it with  no fluorescence and triple X and have it at the same price, if not lower than it was before. And so it's a really unique time to be in this industry. I hearken it back to when I first came in the industry 24 years ago. And I think the prices are back to where they were then, which is kind of crazy, little scary. But on the other side, it presents a great opportunity for someone that is in the natural diamond market. You're saying that when you're buying for a lower price,  and say two years and much lower price than two years ago, you also be able to pass on some of that price decline to your consumers. We pass on almost all that price decline to the consumer. And what we also try to do is make sure that we upgrade the quality of the stone. So if we were buying good cut grades or very good cut grades, now we're buying triple X's and we're able to find an opportunity in certain segments, you know, where there is the market is softer. So we're buying into that segment because we see an opportunity  How hard or easy is it at the moment to find, let's say an SI is for example, a nice SI with no black center, triple X, no fluorescence? How often do you travel to India to buy?  And then we had relationships in India. We've been going. My brother Ryan and I first went almost 20 years ago when it was a different place. And that was before they were selling with papers. Almost everything was parcels and you pick the parcels, you brought them back here, got GIA papers on them and sold them. And today it's a very different business. Where do you actually go to Budges? You go into the diamond voice and meet with a bunch of companies and negotiate with them. Yeah. So it's the diamond voice in the BKC. It used to be the opera house years and years ago.  when we used to go, but yes, today it's the BKC Diamond Bourse and the multiple buildings. I don't know how many, I think it goes from what, A to G maybe, H, and going throughout and just try to schedule appointments next to one another, but you have to have multiple sources because when you go over there, more than just the value you get, it's the understanding that you're in the epicenter of the diamond world. The center of the diamond world happens in India.  And if you want to know what's happening in the diamond world, you have to be at the epicenter, in my opinion. Anywhere else you go to New York, you go to Tel Aviv, you're getting ancillary. But when 90% of the diamonds are coming out of one place, that's where you get to know what is going on and how things are affecting the business, how China not buying right now is affecting the business. Why is China not buying? Because they don't no longer see value in diamonds. How does that affect the long term prospects of the  diamond industry, then coupled with that, what's going on here in America and the synthetic diamonds and will that at some point erode the diamond dream? That's unknown. Europe is not quite what it used to be because the brands aren't buying like they used to be. And how do you find areas of opportunity throughout that? I mean, another thing is when you're over there, when Signet was buying big, there would be certain categories that you just couldn't buy. I mean, because they were categories  How common is it for a U.S. retailer of your size to go directly to India to buy?  That's the way our father learned this business and he taught us to be merchants. And in order to be a merchant, you have to go where the opportunities are. So about 20 years ago, we were buying in New York and we really think there's an opportunity to buy in India. We had never been to India. My brother and I looked at each other, but we said, hey, we're game to try it. Why not? So our dad at the time was running the business and he said, you know, go over there, take $300,000 if you spend $10,000  great if you spend nothing great if you spend all of it great just figure it out see if there's an opportunity so we went over there and I think that first trip we actually had to go back early because our grandfather was sick and I think we spent zero but we found out that that was the place to be and it's interesting too because all of our suppliers in America were telling us how that wasn't the place the cuts weren't right that you have to remember this is 18 to 20 years ago so this was when the US and  and Tel Aviv were the market. And they were all telling us that, you know, you didn't need to go there, that you wouldn't be able to find it. And so from that, what we've learned is, is when everyone points to why you shouldn't do something, it's probably a reason to lean into it and just learn and see if you should. And that's probably been one of our greatest things has been to change our supply chain when it came to diamonds and have that insight and have those relationships in India. The first thing that happened during COVID reached out to all of those vendors  Do you have a sort of panel of suppliers in India? A fixed list of manufacturers that you buy from?  for  Did they still by and large use the fixed price model when they're sending to you?  on how much is on the table, depends on whether you're dealing with commercial goods or certified goods. And it depends on how, what the position is. And I would say the position today is not as strong as it has been in the past. And I certainly don't hear near as much rumblings as that the business is moving to Surratt as I did years ago. I'm just thinking, you're saying that in the past there was more of a fixed price and now, now there's more flexibility. Yes. And when I'm saying more flexibility on everything, just by the fact that  Have you been to Surat?  or the influx of old synthetic diamonds, but yes, it's a pretty amazing place. They don't really have quite the infrastructure today that you see in Mumbai. I mean, it used to be in Mumbai 20 years ago, you would only eat in the restaurants and the hotels today. There are many places that you can eat as a Westerner in Mumbai and feel comfortable as opposed to where Surat, I think, would be more like Mumbai 20 years ago.  again from your YouTube page, you've also been to the Kimberley Mine in South Africa. When was that?  understanding that, seeing how it's a different supply chain in a sense, you know, rough diamonds versus manufactured polished diamonds, and to get a better understanding of what does it take to find that one, you know, diamond that you're searching for out of all this other material, and actually have some material here that we brought back from the mine. So it was an incredible experience. What was that you held out? That was a piece of kimberlate? Yeah, that was a piece of kimberlate. What did you gain from that trip?  from a selling perspective, has it benefited your ability to communicate with consumers now that you can say that you've been to the Kimberley mine and have experienced that? I think the main thing about being in a mine, as you probably would know, Joshua, you're not buying the rough there and then having it. I'm not going to the Kimberley mine to buy the rough and then polish it. That's a different business, right? There is the polished business and then there's the rough business. So it's not so much that you get into the source as much as you understand  how the source makes Africa and South Africa and communities better. In a lot of ways, the only resources that some of these countries have are their natural resources. And if we don't invest in these natural resources and we don't use these natural resources to benefit these communities, then the communities are not as strong. They're not as vibrant. They don't have as many opportunities and they don't have the ability to kind of grow out of poverty in a lot of ways. And so that is really  I think the most significant and then also understanding that from a standpoint of Sustainability these mines when they go offline have to be put back to the way they were if not better so actually they're investing to make sure that the Environment is in a better place than it was before they mined and so I think those to debunk some of the myths that happen with man-made diamonds where we hear about oh, they're eco-friendly or oh  we should be investing in? Well, if we're investing in lab-grown diamonds and not natural diamonds, do people in certain African communities have work? And how does that affect their lives? How do we make sure that we're doing it in the most ethical way possible to help communities and make sure that also that nature is being sustained in an environmentally friendly way? And that's what I learned more than anything.  that's where our family learned. Right. And what does Lee Michaels do to give back to these communities or for the good in general? We are strong believers. One of our core values is giving back to the markets in which we do business. So we give hundreds, if not millions of dollars. Over the years, we've given millions of dollars to our communities. Each year, we give hundreds of thousands of dollars to our communities, working on starting a foundation to give back to our communities as well. We believe strongly that we need to make sure to leave this place a better place than receipt.  And we're strong believers and making sure that our communities are better off tomorrow than they are today. And whatever we can do to make that happen is what we try to do. And as stewards in our business, we also do the same thing. So my brother Ryan has been board chair of J.A. Jewelers of America. I've been president of the American Gym Society and JBC. My brother Chad is on the executive committee of JSA. We want to make sure that  sure that we're involved in not only our local communities, but the jewelry community as a whole.  work in L.A. It may be a year or two before they become something very big here. The other bezel set diamonds, I wouldn't say an engagement rings are starting to really take off here, but they didn't start here. The trends of moving back to yellow gold came here a little later. But the one thing that you get out of the South is family balance. People that care about people, communities that really want to make sure people succeed and making sure that we're here as a community and people that  love people. So Southern hospitality.  It seems to make sense, but empirically, it don't have the data. And finally, what is your outlook for this holiday season? Cautiously optimistic. But I've been cautiously optimistic for the last three years. And somehow the optimist part happens more than the caution, meaning we've had better years than thought. And hopefully we have another good year. But we need to be prepared for years that will be downturns that could happen in the future. And what are we doing from our standpoint of  business to make sure we're prepared so that we're not getting lax and we're not resting on our laurels but we're always looking at how we challenge ourselves as a company to make sure that we continue to be first choice. Great, well thank you very much Scott Berg of Lee Michael's Fine Jewelry. I really enjoyed speaking to you, particularly I've enjoyed hearing how you've gone third of the maybe the average US retailer would and your stories about India and South Africa. I really found that very interesting and very grateful you've given out your time to speak with us. Thank you so much.  Thank you for listening to this episode of the Rappaport Diamond podcast.
