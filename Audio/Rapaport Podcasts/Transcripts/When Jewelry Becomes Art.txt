 Welcome to the Jewelry Connoisseur podcast and now your host Sonia Esther Soltani. Welcome to this new episode of the Jewelry Connoisseur podcast. I'm your host Sonia Esther Soltani, editor-in-chief of Wrap-Up Old. In previous seasons, we've discussed what is jewelry art and today we're going to meet a jewelry artist, Michael Robinson of David Michaels Jewels.  David Michael Jules is a famous jewelry art company that has produced extraordinary pieces for the past 10 years. You might have seen them at Sotheby's or at Steven Russell in New York. Today, Michael is going to share his creative process as well as what he thinks makes jewelry art.  into more the technical side of your work. How did you start in the jewelry business? Oh, I think I started before I even knew I started. My father was in jewelry, so he wasn't a bench jeweler, but he would manage a jewelry store and eventually went on to own jewelry stores. So he was kind of more of a business jewelry person. So, I mean, before and after kindergarten, our kindergarten was close to the store he was managing. So we would go to work with our dad and  And to be kept busy whilst he was setting up the store in the morning, more often than not, we would be dumped in the workshop at four years old, would be given a hammer to play with. And I guess that's where it started. I never, never really stopped playing with hammers. Then I just kept on making them, always knew I wanted to be a jeweler. So in high school, I didn't pay too much attention in classes. I would just always be drawing. And then I dropped out of high school early to start making jewelry and have never stopped.  Do you remember the first jewel you created? Yes, I do. It's very forgettable, though. It wasn't anything particularly spectacular. The first professional jewelry I started making was when I was about 15 years old and I would make little silver pendants to sell at a local clothing store. They weren't anything original. I was heavily into music and I used to make little Wu Tang clam pendants and sell them through clothing stores. And what's interesting is that you mentioned your father  I was in the jewelry business. You've always known about the jewelry industry. You've always known about the trading side, the retailing side. When did you think, I want to make something that is a bit different, that is not mainstream, but is really exceptional and rare? Because for people who are not familiar with your work, yeah, most jewelry connoisseurs are familiar with David Michael, but you only create 12 to 15 pieces a year, which is quite exceptional in this trade. So how do you move from this mainstream jewelry business to exceptional clients  and unique pieces. Like everybody, I started off making lots of great pieces in silver. And then for a long while, I did repairs mostly. Well, maybe about five years, all I did was repairs. To be honest, that was quite boring, mundane work, but it's probably the best grounding in the jewelry industry you can get because you learn where pieces fail. You learn where a chain link's going to break or where things show wear  or what's strong and not. So for five years, I was just doing repair after repair. Whilst I was doing the repairs, I was always thinking about pieces I want to make. And then probably for like the next 20 years, I've pretty much made people's engagement rings. So brand new engagement rings. I'd for the most part speak with the couple and get an idea of what they were looking for and then present them drawings. For a while, that was really interesting because I was interpreting what they were  want, what their budgets were, and coming up with original designs to present to them. But then after 20 years of making engagement rings, I started thinking about more creative pieces I want to do. But the engagement rings were keeping me so busy, I just really didn't have time. And whenever I did have a little bit of time, the works would sell very quickly. So the pivotal moment was when my dad came up to retirement age. My brother and I had gone into his business and were  working for him, which is when I was making engagement rings. And when he retired, I didn't really want to take over that business because I'm more of a workshop guy rather than a client facing person. And then I just had all this pent up creative thoughts. So that was about 10 years ago now for 10 years. I've just been making what I want to make rather than trying to make a client happy. And what is it that you wanted to make? Can you tell us?  listeners, the really intricate gem set jewels. I mean, it's really pieces of art when you see them, you feel like you want to put them on display and just look at them. Can you tell us some of this inspiration and some of the pieces that came out of your workshop for the past 10 years? I think first of all, what I wanted to make was I very much love antique jewelry and I had seen all of the period jewels that are inspired by floral bouquets or by nature.  definitely for the first little while I was making seahorses and different flowers and basically things inspired by nature by reinterpreting in a very colorful sort of three-dimensional way that I wanted to make and I did that probably for about five years-ish then I didn't want to just reinterpret nature anymore because nature has done a really good job of designing and  creating those works. So I kind of morphed into doing more shapes and designs that are purely out of my head, sometimes reinterpreting nature, but making sure that it's gone through my filter enough to be mine rather than just taking something that already exists and turning it into jewelry. Can you pick one piece and tell us a bit more about the Genesis and how it's made and how long it takes and the effort  that is involved, the challenges, is there one piece that you'd like to describe to our listeners? I guess the piece that probably has most attention, that when people meet me they say, oh you're the person that made this piece, is the series of koi ponds that I make. They're obviously quite heavily influenced by a koi pond. When I was a kid I would make little rock garden ponds in the garden with my dad, but I very much morphed them into just stripping down,  trying to look natural at all. I make them into a particular soft rounded shape that I like, which is more like a pebble than a rock. I don't use any castings or anything like that. I start with raw metal, raw lumps of sheet or bar stock and I forge it. I roll it out or hammer it to shape. So the work's completely made by hand. It's not cast. Once it's made, I drill and carefully cover the surface with tiny little holes so that I can see a colorful pave.  into the pieces that I want. And the thing that I love about these koi ponds is that they also feature a little miniature painting of a koi fish that I do on Mother of Pearl. So it really feels like it's a little work of art from start to finish because it's almost like I'm making a tiny little jewel frame for the miniature painting I did. So yeah, I sit down and I make the piece from start to finish. When the work has my name signed to it, it's because it's my work, not another single hand.  and captures the work from start to finish. And then it's also very important for you to draw. I follow you on Instagram and you draw a lot everywhere. I do. We used to see what a color drawing and you draw with the simplest pens. Tell us a bit more about this process because that's fascinating to see and you think which piece of jewelry is going to come out of this drawing, if any. Well, I've just always drawn. Like I said, even in school, it didn't matter which class I was in. I was always drawing. So if it was maths, I was drawing on my notebook.  If it was science, I was drawing pictures on my notebook. So it's a habit that has always really stuck with me. I'm not really much into technology and I was very late adapted to even having something as simple as a cell phone. It was only about five years ago that I got my first cell phone. So what I would do is I would carry around a little pocket notebook and rather than scrolling on my phone whenever I'm anywhere, I'd pick up a pen and draw a little sketch of my notebook.  and making pieces of jewelry is so intensive and I can spend a thousand hours on making a little jewel piece of work whereas I can fill up a sketchbook page with ideas in 20 minutes. So I just love the juxtaposition and how instant drawing is. It's a completely different muscle in my brain that gets worked out when I'm drawing versus making things. So I do, I try to, again, making things takes up so much  I like the creative process. And I was wondering when you create a piece of jewelry, do you have a collector in mind already or you just create a piece of jewelry and you hope that it's going to meet its collector, someone who's going to appreciate the thousands of hours that went into it, the sourcing of gemstones and your own spirit in the piece? Very much the latter. I think it's the most important thing. I think it's the most important thing.  As I said in my younger career, I guess from my father's influence, I was a little more business minded and we didn't have a museum, we had a store. So we were trying to make things that sold. But for the last 10 years or so, I've very much been working like an artist. I try to close out the outside world and I'm very lucky that I don't have to think about what other people want. I'm just purely focused on getting my own ideas out of my head and  into a three dimensional little jeweled sculpture and work of art. And it just gives so, so much freedom. Obviously I'm still grounded by the practicalities of my more fundamental upbringing where I still think about is the work going to be light and comfortable for the end person to wear? Is it going to be durable and not have elements that are going to catch on every fabric or make the work sit  I like this idea of creative freedom, auto creative freedom. So tell us why you're working at the moment.  because normally I'm very focused on working on one piece at a time. But as I said, mentioning going back to the koi pond again, I have made the winter koi pond and I've made the summer koi pond and I'm currently creating the autumn koi pond that I'm working on now. And I'm currently collecting and carving gemstones into leaves to set into this koi pond. I'm working on that project. And I'm also working on another series of works which are going to be a collection of 50  individual little works, some of them will be jewelry, but others are just tiny little jeweled objects that you might sit in your pocket or on a desk. They're kind of part of a special project that I'm not entirely ready to speak about yet. And they're probably two or three years away from being done. But yeah, so exciting.  about jewelry artists much more in the mainstream. It's not this obscure niche topic. It seems like more jurors have come up on the larger scene. So have you seen it yourself in the past 10 years, 20 years that you've been looking at things and seeing it from the inside? Yeah, definitely. You do hear the word jewelry artist a lot more. I have noticed it. It's something, honestly, that I try to shut out and not be entirely aware of. When I'm on social media, I always try to, first of all,  limit my time on there because I don't think it's that productive to getting work done if I get stuck in the track with scrolling on social media. But also I always just like to create rather than consume. It is a topic that I feel quite passionate about personally when I have very strong beliefs about art and what makes jewelry art versus a product. They're my personal beliefs. Sometimes I share them. I never try to convince people or have them necessarily  think the same way I do. But there is, I think maybe the term is used a little looser or it's a little bit more of a PR type thing rather than totally authentic. For me, what makes jewelry art is when it's a singular human person's vision and they sit down and they create it. To me, that makes it art. If we think about traditional artists that paint canvases, these are human  beings that sit down and they paint a canvas from their head. They aren't people that tell other people to paint what's in their head and they aren't people that if they're painting a landscape for example and in the landscape there's a building and they only know how to paint trees. They don't contract the work out to somebody to paint the building and then sign their name to the bottom of it. So I think with jewelry we have to be careful about what is art and what is  product. And I think if you're taking shortcuts that concern making things easier, quicker, or cheaper, then I think you're making a product. I think if you're making art, it's a human being sitting down and creating work through an artistic vision that they have and through their hands and the skills that their hands have built up over time. So yeah, that's something I feel quite passionate about, but again, that's my personal belief.  You know, I think it's beautiful. It's a beautiful distinction between product and art. Who would you consider a jewelry artist? Who are the jewelry artists that you look up to and you find inspiring? The aesthetic is completely different from yours, but you think that that is really art. I have the perfect person that inspires me so much. And he became a mentor of mine in the last year of his life with an artist called Daniel Brush. If the viewers aren't aware of him, I highly recommend Googling him. And there's a few good YouTube videos about him and a few good podcasts.  He was just the epitome of an artist. He did everything himself single-handedly. They were his own artistic vision. Again, they were made of his hand. They weren't designed with the aid of a computer and cast in a machine. They were lumps of material that he sculpted and worked with his hand. And sometimes he made jewelry. Sometimes he made sculpture. Sometimes he did paintings or drawings, but they were always purely of his mind and  And I don't think there's a better poster boy for an artist jeweler than Daniel Brush. He really lived the life. That's a great example. I think there's an exhibition at the moment of his life. There is, yes. He has an exhibition going on in Tokyo at the moment with LeCol that is called Thinking of Monet. A lot of it's more colorful sort of. Well, they weren't colorful, they were metal, but they give off colorful light. But yes, he's very much lives the ethos where  It is art, it's his vision and it's not of other people's hands that he's signing his name to. Thank you. Where can people see your creations, Michael? The easiest way is to again, Google or get onto our Instagram page, David Michael Jules, and there's a collection on there. I share work on there from time to time. I don't share everything. Again, a lot of my work's quite personal and private. Mostly people find me through word of mouth, like if the collector has a piece and they tell their friend,  or if a friend sees them wearing it, they'll track me down. But again, because I'm only hand making a handful of pieces, there isn't a huge collection of work anywhere. They tend to find a new home pretty soon after they're finished. So really the best place to see them would be on our website or social media, but they are welcome to contact me directly and there might be a piece I'm working on and I can share what I'm working on.  everyone to scroll Instagram. Sorry to say that. Once you get on your page, it's very hard to stop scrolling and checking the detail and doing like a zoom in to check all the delicate settings and the stones. So I would really encourage that. And thank you so much, Michael, for sharing a little bit of the life of a jewelry artist with us today. And I'm looking forward to seeing your new creation, the autumn part of the series. If I don't share them publicly, I'll send you a private message. Great.  very privileged. This podcast, no one listens to, so we're good. It means, pardon of listeners, I'm sorry. This is just for me. Yes, exactly. Thank you so much, Michael. Great team.
