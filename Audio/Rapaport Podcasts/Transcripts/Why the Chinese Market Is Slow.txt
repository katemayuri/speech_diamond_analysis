 Welcome to the Rappaport Diamond podcast and now your host, Joshua Friedman.  trading in loose stones. In this context, I spoke with Chen Shen, a diamond dealer and consultant and president of Shanghai-based Skywalk Global, which has grown from being a jewelry trader into an importer and exporter of a broad range of products from clothing to machinery. Chen has been increasingly working with lab-grown diamonds and believes that competition for synthetics and not China's economic slump is the real reason for the country's weak diamond market. I hope you enjoy the conversation.  about this podcast. It is a very important time actually because we've, well it seems like a distant memory now, but we've come off the back of the important Hong Kong show for jewelry and diamonds and the Chinese market is really one of the top topics at the moment in the diamond industry. It's really been very slow in the last few months, if not the last year, and we've really felt the impact of that in the diamond trade with US relatively weak and China being very weak for a long time. So I'm very excited to have you on this. Can I just start by asking you, what does your company do? What is your role in the diamond industry?  Okay. I started this business years ago in the United States trading Emerald. I was in South America a lot and in Columbia falling in love with Emerald. So I started trading Emerald and the year 2012 I come back to China and I'm doing actually TV shopping. That time I'm mainly doing the yellow diamond. One carats yellow diamond on the TV shopping. Then from there I do the also the white diamond.  when I carried two carers on TV shopping. And that time was very good for the diamond. I mean, 10, 12 years ago, yellow diamond, you know, not as like now, all over the market. That time I was probably the biggest when carers yellow diamond buyer in Hong Kong market. Every time I need to buy a hundred piece, I need to go to so many different companies. You know, here this company five piece, then the company ten piece to get a hundred pieces for my program.  I can sell like really 100 pieces in 40 minutes. GIA, yellow diamond. And now I'm more focused on for the private clients and the TV shopping business is changing. People more and more look on the internet, live stream. Less people watch TV. Very few people watch TV now. So the TV shopping business is total different now. So now my business is more focused on the private clients. Right, sure.  about the Chinese market. I always know I can go to you for some good insights on what's happening. In the context of that, I wanted to ask about how the recent show in Hong Kong actually was because the reports that we got, and I think this is largely confirmed when we spoke a couple of weeks ago, was that it was a very disappointing show for the diamond industry. The diamond haul was very slow. And this was really as expected though, because Chinese buyers are just not showing much demand at the moment. You're absolutely correct. Hong Kong show is terrible for diamond. I went to the diamond show, you can see  All the basically people doing the exhibition there. You can see very few buyers. You talk to the people, the mood was not good. And the diamond market is really, really slow. And I heard that dealers in Shanghai diamond chain, they did not sell one diamond in three months, not even one piece. Right. Were the Chinese buyers present? They just didn't buy or they just didn't turn up at all? I think they didn't, more didn't turn up at all. They didn't buy. I mean, from what I heard in  Shanghai diamond exchange, many big retails don't buy any diamond for stocking now. And stop-buy like the Lao Feng Xiang, that's one of the biggest retail in China. Of course, its main business is gold, but still it's over 5,000 retail stores. They don't buy diamond for stocking. They used to buy diamond for some stocking, but now they completely stop. Basically, all the retails. So the market is terrible in Shanghai.  All the dealers in Shanghai that make change, they don't think this situation will change anytime soon.  happened is because the economy in China or the more specific issues related to diamonds that's influencing this?  think diamond this kind of market with the live diamond and it's kind of permanent shift. Even in China, it's very slow shift. But we see these trends coming. I see that the Israeli company, I'm just saying, I don't mention name, they are used to quite big, they have a big stock in Shanghai Diamond Exchange. Now they're dealing with the live diamond. They now buy any new natural diamond for stocking. They sell in the inventory and they lose  money on every sale but in order to survive so now they're dealing with the live diamond and actually turnover is quite fast even though they not make as much money as in the natural diamond but live diamond turnover is fast most the sales of the live diamond what i say is from a small designer on the internet all this not through big retail but the trends are there and we see the dealer  This all talk to me about the live diamond, even though it does not make much money as the natural diamond, but turnover is faster, so still good money. So the trend is there, and I think this is a permanent trend. Even though if the future economy comes back, many people feel the diamond will not be the same as three years ago, let's say.  that lab-grown diamonds are really a US product and the Chinese consumer showed very little interest in lab-grown diamonds. But why would you say that has changed over the last few years? The price point, the economy?  and now we reach that point. Because you went at 70% of the natural diamond, people don't see the value on the live diamond. Chinese don't buy that for the, like it's a green product, they don't buy for that. They see the value. And when you have a 20% something of the natural diamond, then people see the value. Live diamond and the natural diamond, you cannot visually distinguish them. They look the same. Many people argue you're not  You know the lab color stone was there for many, many years. They don't affect the natural color stone business. But lab color stone, you can see the difference. Most people can identify and say, this is a lab, not a natural color stone, because it's way too clean. The color is not right. Also, we can prove on this is the color lab diamond. The color is not natural, people, most people can tell.  That's why we don't see much price decline on the color diamond. You're talking here about whether they're natural color or whether they're naturally made. No, you can kind of distinguish them, can separate them. A natural color diamond and a lab color diamond. The colors are very different. People look at that lab color diamond, wait a minute, this is look different from the natural color diamond. But this is not the case for the white  diamond. You look at them, you cannot tell. And when you compare them at 20% of the natural diamond, people find value on that. Right. Still, the general explanation given for why China is so weak at the moment is the economy. It sounds like you disagree with that. I think even if the one economy comes back, the diamond business is not going to come back as the way it is. And China's economy is weak, but still this year, I'm in government for  is going to grow 5% and I look at the sales I called some friends about this just past the Chinese National Holiday Golden Week on the luxury brand sales. Cartier Tiffany not doing very well, okay? But one exception is Van Cleef Au Pair. This brand sales are double last year during the Golden Week, double. It sells very, very well, but Tiffany, Cartier, they're not doing well because the product  people's conceptions, their product lines are old, marketing is still the same. Also, we see gold is doing very well. That's taken money from the diamond buyer. Pearl is doing very, very well. So this is not like the jewelry industry because some sectors are doing very well. It's not about the whole business. It's a diamond problem. It's not a jewelry problem. Another factor is the people  getting married. Chinese marriage, I think registered marriage in 2013 was the highest, over 13 million. And last year it was only 7 million. So drop a lot. So you see, one of the biggest buyers of diamond is the photo from the wedding, right? Bridal. And the registered wedding is every year like a 10% drop. That's another factor. But I think the diamond business, you need more innovation. And why gold is doing so  Well in the past few years, one of the things is gold has lots of innovation in the past few years They come out with lots of new products, 3D gold and they can do lots like pure gold 99% pure gold they can do in lots of settings just like 18k gold now they create lots of interesting products and so people spend money on that and the diamond there is still the same, nothing changed  business  the YZ color, but they come out great. We did 80 facets, come down to the 50 facets, and actually at the 55 facets actually look better. And I bought them back in China and my clients, you know, they didn't even need a GI certificate, they bought them right away. Right. And with the lab-grown material, you can take more risks with these things because the rough is not as valuable. Yeah. This trend that you described, how does that affect  your business, has your business shifted more towards lab-grown in line with what you've described going on more widely in the market?  diamond or colorstone but I'm offering a different cutting, offer something more interesting, a different value, a different product. I cannot do that with the natural diamond. It's way too expensive, too much risk to do that. For the dealers, they have to offer something, a product different because everyone is selling the wrong diamond. You can compare price and who offers you lowers the price. You have to offer more  interesting products. So even in the natural market, would you say interesting shapes or just to begin with regular fancy shapes? Are they selling better in China at the moment than rounds? Not necessarily. People still buy round diamond, but for people like my clients, they all have the round diamond. They want to buy something different. They're not buying for wedding. And of course, people for wedding, they still buy the round diamond. But for the people who want to everyday like a lady, they want to buy something to please themselves.  They want to do something interesting. They don't want to buy another round diamond. You have to offer something different. They want to go out to show their friends, I have something different than you. That's come out in innovation. You have very interesting cutting and very few dealers can take this kind of risk. Right. If you take just the regular, the common fancy shapes, the pears, cushions, marquise, things like that, how are they doing in the natural market in China at the moment? They like all the diamond,  We're doing much better than in the past. People are more accepting of fancy diamonds. I mean, at least three or four years ago, people still wanted better. We see more and more people looking for something different. Of course, my clients are more mature clients, and they have the wrong diamond from the wedding, and they want something different. But, you know, for weddings, still people say, I want the wrong diamond. I think a different cutting is the future, because dealing with the color stone,  I see how the different cuttings affect the color and the brilliance of the stone. So I try to see some more cutting like we see in the color stone on the diamond. And it comes out actually great. I sell them very easily. I think that's actually the future. Who says that we have to buy a wrong diamond? You have to offer some product more exciting to the consumer. How much of the market would you say is lab-grown at the moment, the Chinese diamond market? I think it's very small, but it's growing.  faster. I cannot put a percentage. I don't have any actual numbers. No one actually counts this. But when I talk to the old dealers in the Shanghai diamond exchange and people deal with that, the volume, many people feel lab diamond is here and they stay and they certainly affect the natural diamond business permanently. And a certain piece of the market gone forever. Even so, maybe the economy come back,  diamond will not come back like the way it was. Right, not what a lot of our listeners want to hear. Chen, just finally before we finish, a final question about the upcoming season. We've got the holiday season coming up, the Chinese New Year. Well, what are your predictions? What's your outlook for the holidays, for the fourth quarter holidays and also the Chinese New Year? The outlook for the fourth quarter and the Chinese New Year, I think economy going to get better, but this does not help the diamond markets. I really think diamond markets is kind of  gone forever and certainly will not have some quick recovery in China on the diamond price or anything. Thank you very much Chen for answering my questions and having this great conversation. For everyone's sake, I hope the situation over there improves and diamond demand comes back. But as you say, there's a lot to be concerned about. Thank you, Joshua, for inviting me to talk about the Chinese diamond markets. It is my pleasure to talk about this. Thank you very much.
