 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market Comment. The JCK Las Vegas show is coming up in just over a week, and I'm really looking forward to the De Beers breakfast on Friday May 31st. This isn't because of the croissants and coffee, but because the company is expected to set out its strategy and view of the diamond market. The announcement couldn't come at a more important time. On May 14th, Anglo-American confirmed it planned to divest i.e. sell De Beers or demerge it. This follows weeks  of rumours that the mining conglomerate wanted to sell the diamond company. It also follows two takeover bids for Anglo from rival BHP, both of which Anglo rejected. The decision reflects two current realities. The first is that Anglo wants to fend off BHP's attempts to acquire it. To do this, it is restructuring and getting rid of non-core assets. This will ensure copper represents a larger proportion of its total production. Copper is Anglo's  most important product as it is crucial for electrical applications and renewable energy. According to the Financial Times, Anglo is trying to present its shareholders with a proposition that is more valuable to them in the long term than if BHP were to buy the business. The company also plans to offer its nickel, steelmaking, coal and platinum businesses. This will leave it with three core divisions, copper, premium iron ore, which is important for steel production, and crop nutrients. The crop nutrients  to stay in development, and in fact, Angola said it would reduce investment in this, but in the long term it hopes that polyhalite, the natural fertilizer it plans to produce, will be vital to sustainable agriculture. The second reality is that diamonds are not as central to Angola as they used to be. Lab-grown diamonds are a fresh competitor on the block, marriage rates are falling, consumer sentiment in the US is mixed, while demand for diamonds in China is very slow as we have discussed in past videos. As I wrote in a recent analysis on the beer,  the company is also facing unprecedented political challenges, especially around its fragile relationship with the Botswana government. De Beers CEO Al Cook, who will be at the breakfast at JCK, said he was confident De Beers would remain the diamond leader for the next century. He also said there was an ongoing recovery in demand for rough diamonds and a positive outlook for the sector. I expect his presentation in Las Vegas to focus on the downstream segment, namely De Beers retail and wholesale brands.  Forevermark diamond brand that it would phase out supplying loose diamonds and become a jewelry brand focused on India, where its recognition among consumers is high. It will also no doubt have something to say about De Beers Jewelers, its higher end retail brand, and of course about Lightbox, its lab-grown diamond brand which recently announced a sharp price cut. What's next for De Beers as a corporate group? According to Reuters, Anglo-American is planning an initial public offering or IPO for De Beers, meaning it would float the company's  on a stock exchange likely in London, but there's still the possibility another entity such as an investment fund or a luxury house could acquire the business or parts of it. This is probably the biggest change in the diamond market in decades. It comes alongside other new and important challenges, not least the G7 sanctions on Russian diamonds. It's certainly quite a time to be in this industry. Please don't forget to subscribe to get every new video we make on a weekly basis discussing trends and analysis in the diamond industry.
