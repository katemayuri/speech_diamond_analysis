 Hello and welcome back to our first Rappaport Market comment after the short break we took for Passover. I hope everyone celebrating had an enjoyable holiday. Since it's a quiet time of the year for the diamond industry, I thought we'd take a detour from the day-to-day news to talk about a topic I find especially interesting. Which diamonds are traditionally popular in different parts of the world? Let's start with the US. When traders talk about an American diamond, they don't mean it was mined or manned.  manufactured in the US, but that it's the type of diamond that sells well there. Generally, those are diamonds of 40 pointers or larger. The average centre stone for engagement rings in America hovers at just above the 1 carat mark, depending on the survey you read. Panning out to US diamond preferences more generally, demand is usually focused on the medium quality range, F to J colour and VS2 to I1 clarity. This inclination reflects the budget-conscious nature of the American  shopper. Americans also buy a broad range of fancy shapes, with these tending to offer lower prices than rounds. Now let's look at what people in other countries like best. We're talking here in broad terms and not just about engagement rings. In China, round diamonds are still dominant, and people purchase smaller but higher quality diamonds. 30-pointer stones are traditionally popular there. While there is some reluctance to buy diamonds with a number 4 in the carrot size, such as 40-pointers, as 4 is considered  an unlucky number in Chinese culture. As for clarities, Chinese consumers were in the past big buyers of VVS diamonds, but now the typical ranges of VS1 to SI1. As we said in our February the 8th video, Chinese buyers apparently shifted to higher colours but lower clarities during last year's economic slump. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan traditionally prefers 30-pointers with DTF colour and VVS clarity, as do such emerging markets as Vietnam and Cambodia.  India? There is really a tale of two markets. The south of the country is wealthier and tends to buy D to H coloured diamonds with VVS to VS clarity. The north, which is poorer on average, opts for G to L coloured VS to SI clarity diamonds. The European market is also mixed. The UK is rather like the US, focusing on the lower qualities. Germany and Switzerland are particular about quality, leaning towards diamonds under 1 carat and often 40 to 50 pointers, with high colour and clarity.  That's the geographical survey, but don't forget there's another factor. International luxury brands such as Cartier, Tiffany, Van Cleef and Arpels buy top colours and clarities irrespective of where they're going to sell them. In summary, the older, more mature diamond markets such as the US and UK have developed broader diamond preferences to accommodate a range of budgets. In the less established markets, however, diamonds are still predominantly for the higher-end consumer. This is something to keep in mind when  watching how countries diamond markets develop over time. Are there certain diamond buying preferences where you live?
