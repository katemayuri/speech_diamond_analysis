 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market comment.  We've seen this reflected in prices. The wrappy index for 1k diamonds has fallen by around 16% since the start of 2024. What happened? This graph shows India's rough imports by value. Imports dropped gradually throughout 2023 as the market responded to the decline in demand caused by competition from synthetics, economic uncertainty, and a slowdown in China. They slumped in November because of the import pause, but as you can see, they bounced back quite fast.  In this one, you can see India's imports by volume. There was a big spike in February, which is the last data we had at the time of that video I mentioned at the beginning, just when the market was looking like it might be recovering. One of the reasons for the spike was a reduction in rough prices at De Beers' January site. The company kept prices steady during the 2023 downturn, but lowered them at the first set of 2024. According to parent company Anglo-Americans Production Report last week, De Beers' rough price index  slid 17% between 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. This stimulated rough purchases by manufacturers, of which most are in India. But the hopes of recovery that existed in February appear now to have been short-lived. Rough imports came down in the following months, but so did polished exports, which indicate levels of overseas demand. Now, let's examine how polished exports performed as a percentage of rough imports. To me, this is the best signal we have of how well India's rough buying matches polished  demand. The higher the percentage, the better India is doing as a polished exporter relative to how much rough it is importing. In the past 4 months, this percentage has increased slightly when you look at both value and volume. This is a good sign. However, if we zoom out and look at the first half of 2024, we see a decline compared to the past half years. It's not easy for Indian manufacturers to reduce rough buying and polished production. Many of them rely on rough purchases to maintain their credit lines.  Those that buy from De Beers and Arosa through supply contracts are under pressure to continue buying from them to maintain their future access to rough. Also, many companies want to keep workers busy and are reluctant to fire them. However, this could change in the second half of this year. De Beers offers siteholders enhanced flexibility at its July trading session, which took place this week in Botswana. The miner also said last week it was exploring ways of reducing production, though this is to save money rather than to help the industry.  have already fell 90% year on year in the first half of 2024. How will the industry manage to balance supply and demand? Let me know your predictions in the comments.
