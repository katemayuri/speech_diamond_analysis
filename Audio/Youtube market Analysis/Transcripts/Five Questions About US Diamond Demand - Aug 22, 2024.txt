 Hello and welcome back to the Rappaport Market comment. The diamond market is quiet this summer, partly for the usual seasonal reasons, and partly because demand is weak, even for the time of year. But with the fourth quarter holidays coming up soon, industry members will return for their vacations, wondering if the season in the US will signal a turnaround for the market. On that note, here are five questions about the state of the US diamond market, the answers to which could well determine the extent to which the industry recovers.  But before getting into them, we have a request for you. Please like this video or subscribe to this channel if you haven't done so already. You can also comment down here and share your suggestions for topics we should follow in the coming weeks. Now, going back to our questions about the US market. First, when, if ever, will retailers start buying diamonds for inventory? We have heard a lot of reports of duellers being cautious about their purchases and taking goods on memo to minimize risk. Will this change as the season approaches?  be determined by consumer demand of course, as well as their existing inventory levels. The Indian diamond manufacturing sector has slashed its production levels to try and rebalance supply and demand, as we have reported on Rappaport.com. But certainly a return to inventory buying by US retailers would greatly help this cause.  comparatively high, as do interest rates. There is also a presidential election on November 5, an event that often causes uncertainty and pushes Americans to defer investment decisions until they have more clarity about government policy. This includes the desirability of natural diamonds as a consumer product and as an investment, as well as the impact of synthetic diamonds. Will synthetic diamonds grow their market share this holiday?  and natural diamonds impact consumer decisions. Will consumers take advantage of price drops to get a cheaper deal or will they use the same budget to get a bigger or higher quality stone than before? On a similar topic, check out the video we made a few months ago explaining how consumers have been shifting to synthetic diamonds instead of natural ones because of the price. And finally, question number five. Will profit margins on synthetics continue to fall in dollar terms and if so, will retailers start encouraging consumers to buy  natural instead of lab grown? I would like to hear your predictions in the comments. A lot of these questions won't be answered for several weeks or even months, but these are some of the key things I will be keeping my eyes open for this holiday season.  link to take part.
