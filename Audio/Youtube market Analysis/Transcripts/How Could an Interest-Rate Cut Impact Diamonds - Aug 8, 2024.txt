But before getting into possible outcomes, we have a request for you. Please like this video or subscribe to the channel if you haven't done it already.

First, consumer demand. The higher the interest rates, the more expensive life tends to become for those who borrow. That is, of course, chiefly homeowners with mortgages. Their spending power is reduced when interest rates rise and vice versa. If the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, this will trickle down to middle class Americans. However, those who have lots of savings might lose out from lower returns if interest rates fall, so this could negatively impact the higher end segment. Second, the cost of borrowing has consequences for businesses.  rates negatively impact companies' profit margins because financing is more expensive. This would ease if the rate comes down. In particular, diamond dealers and retailers would likely see a reduction in the cost of inventory finance, the credit they get from banks to fund purchases of goods that they will sell later. With a lower interest rate, it's likely diamond buyers would have an easier time buying inventory outright rather than taking goods on memo, which has become very common in recent years, partly because of the cost of holding inventory.  to prop up the value of the dollar as they attract investment from foreign entities and increase demand for the currency. However, there are many things that impact the value of the dollar, so predictions are notoriously hard to make. But if rates were to fall, the dollar would likely weaken. This could have many implications, including making business easier for overseas companies that export diamonds to the US. This is because they sell in US dollars but incur costs in their local currency.  interest rates and gold demand, though some claim this connection is not significant. In theory, when interest rates are high, gold has more competitors as an investment, as people can make a lot of money from bonds and other financial investments. So it's possible that gold could gain in price even beyond its current highs. We'll have to wait till next month to see if the interest rate drops, and several more months to understand the real impact of this. What do you expect will happen? Let us know in the comments.
