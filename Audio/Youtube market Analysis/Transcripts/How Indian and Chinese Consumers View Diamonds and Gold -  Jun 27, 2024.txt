 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market comment. Soon we will have more news to share with you, so please subscribe to this channel if you haven't done until now.  diamond prices were likely to grow between 3% and 5% from 2023 to 2033. De Beers highlighted this at a breakfast event at JCK Las Vegas on May 31. The challenge with this kind of prediction is it involves assumptions, but the biggest influences on the industry tend to be major unexpected events such as the pandemic or the Ukraine War. The diamond industry is inherently unpredictable. Considering that, over the next three weeks I want to focus on two important points the  about what has happened in the industry and one about how a Boston consulting group has factored in the unknown when making its forecasts. This week we'll look at the report's comparison between consumer markets in the US, China and India. We have talked before about which diamonds are popular among consumers in different parts of the world. You can click here on the link to watch that other video. The report noted that demand for luxury goods including diamonds usually correlates with real gross  domestic product, or GDP, and with personal disposable income. However, this correlation has not been equal in those three markets. In the US, diamond demand has been somewhat stronger than you would expect given levels of disposable income. This is because of a post-COVID bump in weddings and a greater emphasis on emotional gifting and self-reward, the report says. However, in China, natural diamond demand has slowed relative to growth in personal income over the past few years.  And in India, the desire for diamond jewelry has grown. Let's look at some of the numbers.  choice, compared with 7% in 2018. During the same period, gold jewelry slumped by that measure to 7% from 16%. Another relevant data point the report highlights, gold ownership in China increased by approximately 30 percentage points between 2018 and 2022, while diamond ownership remained flat. Just this week, TSL, a Hong Kong-based jeweler with a significant China business, estimated losses of up to 48.7%.  $7 million for the past fiscal year following weak demand for natural diamond jewelry on the mainland. So why is China gone for gold and India for diamonds? Boston Consulting Group gave several possible and interrelated reasons for China's increased focus on gold. Household saving intentions are at a record high amid economic uncertainty. This favours gold, which has a reputation as a secure investment. The price of gold has also risen sharply, strengthening this perception.  Furthermore, younger Chinese consumers view gold jewelry as symbols of Chinese tradition and heritage, alongside that enduring investment value. However, younger Indian consumers acknowledge gold's long-term value, but don't see it as the most desirable choice, according to the report, which cited the World Gold Council. In particular, the report said,  India are showing more interest in modern jewellery designs, pushing them towards diamonds. Also, retailers are currently incentivised to promote diamond jewellery because they offer bigger margins. The group made another important observation about the India jewellery market. It is dominated by local brands and unbranded jewellery. This means that category marketing of diamonds has a larger share of voice than in other markets. In other words, category marketing in India has fewer competitors than in the US, where  big diamond brands are also spending money on marketing. This gives a greater opportunity for marketing diamonds as a category in India, over and above the growing interest in diamonds. It probably also explains why De Beers has decided to focus its Forevermark consumer brand on India where few competing local brands exist. In conclusion, the picture the report paints of the global diamond retail market is quite positive. The US is doing ok, and India is growing as a source of diamond demand.  big problem is China, and that doesn't look like changing soon.
