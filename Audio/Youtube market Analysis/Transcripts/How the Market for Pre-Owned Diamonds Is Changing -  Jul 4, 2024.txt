 They are broken!  Recycled goods are a small part of the overall market. They account for less than 10% of the total supply of natural polished diamonds, according to the report. Recycled diamonds in jewelry, in the sense that people usually use the terms, refer to goods that a consumer has already owned and have re-entered the market. This can happen either with the jewelry staying intact or with the metal being melted and the diamonds removed and resold as loose stones or even as a piece of metal.  It's worth noting that the term recycled has been criticised in the jewelry context because it doesn't come from waste material. But it's the term that most people use. As the report points out, the main reasons for these diamonds coming on the market are divorce, financial necessity, death of the owner, or simply changes in preferences. It says the proportion of recycled diamonds currently coming on the market due to inheritance  around 20% and will likely increase as the people who originally acquired the diamonds die. As for the remaining 80% coming from non-inheritance sources, the report predicted that these factors would likely remain steady with the fluctuating price of diamonds impacting the desire to sell. I want to zoom in on an important observation. The proportion of diamonds removed from recycled jewelry and sold as new has steadily declined in recent years, the report said. In 2021, it stood at about  percent of the total value of diamonds in recycled jewelry, down from 60 percent in 2015. Why did this happen? Boston Consulting Group believes there are influences on the sell side and the buy side. Firstly, sellers can get more value from vintage jewelry by selling them intact rather than removing the stones. The report estimated that reintroducing diamonds into the supply chain reduced their value by 30 to 40 percent because the dealer needs to make a margin and due to the cost of melting  logistics, testing, and proving authenticity, and if necessary, the cost of recutting. They also must compete on price with newly produced diamonds. Unlike with gold, there's also a lack of ways to trade recycled diamonds and a lack of transparency on their price, according to the report. Buyers also prefer intact pieces. They value the unique design, affordability, and sustainability aspects of vintage jewelry, to quote the report. This makes the vintage jewelry piece more than just the sum of its parts.  Finally, there is an increasing number of online consumer-to-consumer platforms that make it easy to trade in second-hand vintage jewelry from eBay to Etsy. Vossling Consulting Group predicts that this trend will continue, leading to recycled diamonds becoming an increasingly smaller proportion of total natural diamond supply. One question I have is whether this really reflects the entire recycled market. I understand the value in trading a signed Cartier piece on eBay or another platform, but what about the massive  of average quality goods to come on the market. Also, the price of gold is at a record high, even if prices of diamonds are not. Is it now the best time to break up jewelry pieces and melt down the gold, leaving a bunch of loose diamonds that need to be resold? Let us know what you think in the comments.
