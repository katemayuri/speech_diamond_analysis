However, a new hub has come to the fore in the past year, the Surat Diamond Bourse, located in the city of Surat about 270 kilometres north of Mumbai. As we have said in past videos, Surat is where 90% or more of India's diamond manufacturing takes place.  place. Now the city is trying to become a trading centre as well. That is the aim of the new 6.6 million square foot Surat boss, which officially opened in December 2023. But the launch has been bumpy. In January, Kirin Jent, one of the biggest backers of the new boss, reopened its office in Mumbai.

Anup Mehta, president of the Bharat Diamond Bourse, said the expansion plans were unrelated to the Surat Diamond Bourse's slow start. Mehta has frequently pointed out that there is no rivalry between the two exchanges. He believes it's a matter of time before the Surat Bourse grows. Just as the Bharat Diamond Bourse took a while,  to develop. Beyond all the speculation, the SDB may simply be the victim of bad timing. The market is difficult now for many Indian diamond tears, with shaky overseas demand and uncertainty around the G7 sanctions on Russian diamonds. As such, many feel investing in a new diamond district is risky at the moment. What do you think of the board's prospects? Let us know in the comments.  Find out more at Wrapnet.com.
