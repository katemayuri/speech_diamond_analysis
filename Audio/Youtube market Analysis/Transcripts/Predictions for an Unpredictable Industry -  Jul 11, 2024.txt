The factors affecting diamond prices for the past four years since the COVID-19 pandemic, such as synthetics, economic uncertainty and midstream destocking, will subside the report forecast. Also, tighter natural diamond supply will boost this price trend. This is what Boston Consulting Group calls the most likely corridor. But other scenarios are possible.  yet less probable, it believes. But what if you do change your assumptions about the industry? Consumer demand could be weaker. New products could emerge that take away market share from diamonds. The acceptability of wearing outward displays of wealth and success could change, especially in markets with historically less diamond marketing. And here's an interesting possibility. Natural diamond supply is quite concentrated in certain geographical locations, such as Southern Africa,  Russia and Canada. What if geopolitical factors affect demand for diamonds from a particular place, as has already happened with Russian goods? In addition, a rise in demand for an access to recycled jewelry, which we discussed last week on our video, could also reduce demand for new goods. Finally, while Boston Consulting Group believes there will likely be differentiation between natural and synthetic diamonds, meaning consumers will come to see them as two separate products, the long-term impact of synthetics remains uncertain.  In short, the desirability of natural diamonds is the key, undetermined factor. Those are the possible downward forces. Let's look at how the diamond market could do better than expected. There could be total differentiation between natural diamonds and synthetics. This would mean that consumers would view the two categories as completely separate, resulting in no cannibalization of natural diamonds. Furthermore, a small increase in market share for natural diamonds in China, where sales are currently very weak,  have a large overall effect given the size and importance of the Chinese market. Finally, there are countries such as Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil where the middle class is expected to grow in wealth over the next decade, according to the report. The model for this is India, where the expanding middle class is already propelling diamond demand as we discussed two weeks ago. Which of these sets of influences is more likely?
