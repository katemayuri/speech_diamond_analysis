 When I write about a company's results, I like to categorise stories as an up or a down because that helps readers to understand. But with some issues, it's just too blurry to side with their good or bad news. Signet Jewelers' earnings for the second fiscal quarter, which they announced last Thursday, were a case in point. Sales fell year on year. The US retailer, which owns K Jewelers, Zales and other brands, reported a heavy loss. But the price of its shares on the stock market rose 11% on the same day. What's going on?  Before getting into the numbers, please hit the button down here to like this video. And if you are watching us like many others every week, we invite you to give us some feedback about our latest videos and suggest what we should talk about in the coming weeks. Now let's look at some of the factors that pull us in different directions. First, Signet's group revenue declined 8% year on year for the three months that ended August 3rd. The company said this reflected the impact of ongoing economic challenges on consumer spending.  a slower recovery in engagements than previously expected, pricing pressure from competitors, door closures, and the sale of luxury watch stores in the UK in late 2023. Second, some slight changes to the company's reporting calendar meant that some sales related to Mother's Day were shifted to the first quarter of this year, whereas last year they counted towards the second quarter. These factors outweighed the benefits that came from new product assortments in the fashion jewelry store.  segment and improvements in engagement trends, though, as we noted, this improvement was not as good as expected. Remember that Cignaz has long argued that we were due a bump in engagements because of the delayed impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a short term slowdown in dating. The company believes this recovery has begun. It's just been sluggish because of the economic challenges. Let's go to the positives. First, there has been a gradual easing of the decline in Cignaz's same  the  share price. But before we get to a conclusion, we need to dig deeper into another observation, which is a firmly negative one. Why does Cigna record a loss of $98.5 million for the second quarter? The answer is asset impairment charges of $166.2 million, without which the company would have been in the black. A company incurs an impairment charge when an asset it owns gets devalued. It counts towards the company's losses. In this case, the weak recovery and engagements force Cigna to devalue some of its divisions that are more skewed towards the bridal  segment. These include Diamonds Direct, a store chain the group acquired for $490 million in 2021 when the market was much better. The company also booked a $7 million impairment charge related to the Diamonds Direct in trade name, meaning it reduced its value. And it took a hit of $36 million for the devaluation of the Blue Nile trade name and a further $123 million related to the combined digital banners unit, which also includes James Allen. Signet said the digital banners as well as being exposed to the engagement market  from declines in prices of synthetic diamonds. To sum up, Signet had a mixed quarter, with figures deteriorating in absolute terms, but also with some signs of improvement. However, the disappointing rebound in engagements has taken its toll. Is this a clear up or a clear down? Well, uncertainty pretty much sums up the current situation. Let us know in the comments how you would rate the state of US retail right now.
