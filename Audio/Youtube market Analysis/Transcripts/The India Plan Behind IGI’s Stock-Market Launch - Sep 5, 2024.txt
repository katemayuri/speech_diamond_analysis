 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market comment. 594 pages is the length of the prospectus document that the International Gerological Institute or IGI published with its initial public offering or IPO. Last week we discussed three facts from it on this video as you might have seen. The company declined to comment beyond what was in that prospectus, but there is a lot of information in it. I noticed through reading the document that IGI is not merely listing on a socket change,  It also has a plan to change the structure of the global business. And today we are going to dig a little deeper into what this means for the company. Let's start by describing IGI at present.  India, the grading lab's largest section, which also owns IGI Turkey, IGI Netherlands, which owns subsidiaries in the Middle East, China, and other countries, and IGI Belgium, which owns IGI USA. IGI India, which is issuing shares on two Indian stock exchanges, wants to use some of the proceeds of the IPO to acquire the other two arms of IGI, Belgium and the Netherlands, from BCP. According to the document, BCP would directly own IGI India, which would then own and be responsible for all the rest  of the business. This acquisition will cost an estimated $131 million, the filing says. The largest part of the non-India business is IGI Belgium, which again includes the US, where the organization has three labs. Revenue from IGI Belgium came to around $18 million in 2023, according to the filing. That is about a quarter of the revenue of IGI India, which brought in 76 million, as we said last week. The filing doesn't say how much revenue IGI USA makes, as far as I could tell. What is this document telling us?  IGI was founded by the Lorry family in Belgium in 1975. What this move indicates is that after becoming increasingly focused on the India market, it's also planning to switch control of the global business to India. The IPO filing also follows the appointment of India-based Tamas Printer as CEO last year when he replaced Antwerp-based Roland Lorry. A source told Indian newspaper Money Control that these acquisitions would have happened irrespective of the stock market's rotation.  But this method enabled it to do them in a more timely and cost effective way by tapping into the strong Indian IPO market. Behind the IPO is actually a transition. IGI is becoming less Europe based and more India based. Given its revenue distribution and the fact that India is central to natural and synthetic diamond manufacturing, that makes a lot of sense.
