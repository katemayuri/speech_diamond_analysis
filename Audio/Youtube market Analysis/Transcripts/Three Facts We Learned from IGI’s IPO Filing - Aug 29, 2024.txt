 Hello and welcome back to the Rappaport Market Comment.  week, the filing presents a wealth of information about IGI's global business.  industry. And at this point, I'd like to take the opportunity to give a shout out to our video producer, Vernina Pickhole, and our videographer, Laylee Films, for producing this video on a weekly basis. This is going to be a two-part series, as there's so much to say. But for now, let's jump through three key facts we learned from the IGI public offering.  the world's second largest diamond grading lab behind, of course, the GIA.  20% came from the jewellery grading and 19% from natural diamonds. Less than 1% was from education services. This makes IGI a unique business, giving it a selling point that distinguishes it from the GIA. It's also a feature that may well be attractive for investors who see synthetics as a major element of the jewellery market in the future. This is the most important IPO of a diamond related company for a while.  and as we have seen has a strong position in lab grown diamonds and finished jewelry. Being a listed company will mean IGI will publish its financial data on a regular basis, providing information for competitors and the entire market. From a journalist perspective, this is also going to offer us great information about the organization and the state of the diamond grading sector. Watch out for more!  for you.
