 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market Comment. The JCK Las Vegas show starts this Friday. Last week I wrote down 5 market trends to watch out for. This time I want to focus on one of the biggest issues that will dominate the show. What is going on with diamond marketing? To state the obvious, the diamond industry has no future without consumer demand and this requires marketing. But the Natural Diamond Council, the NDC,  has less money available since Arosa stopped funding it in 2022 following the start of the Russian-Ukraine war. As we discussed in previous videos, the landscape of the industry is also changing at a fast pace, creating new challenges for diamond marketing. Here are my three questions for the industry at the show.  trading company Ocovango Diamond Company as its first non-mining member, and adding a range of partners, most recently diamond manufacturer Oro Star. This will go some way in compensating for the loss of Alrosa, which alongside De Beers, was its largest financial contributor. Does it have the funding it needs? Will its actions have an effect on demand? Second, what categories will diamond marketing focus on? A week before the show, De Beers at Signet Jewelers, the US's largest diamond  retailer, announced they would cooperate on a campaign to showcase the inherent rarity and timelessness of natural diamonds. Research by Signet indicated there would be an upswing in proposals and engagements among what it calls US Zillennials over the next 37 months. That's people on the younger end of millennials and the older end of Gen Z, born in the mid 1990s. This follows a lull due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19 lockdowns  three to four years ago, which according to Signet led to a delayed drop in engagements. Does this single a focus on engagement ring marketing for the time being? And how does this relate to the way consumers view natural diamonds as opposed to lab-grown? And also what product types will the industry promote aside from engagement rings? Third, what is the role of Botswana? Botswana's new sales deal with De Beers calls for eventually 50% of the  country's rough to go to state-owned Ocovango Diamond Company for sale. This means that Ocovango and the Botswana government itself will become more of a competitor to the beers in the diamond market. I noticed a few things about the pre-show publicity.  a time of recording, but it appears to be a luxury brand for Voxwana diamonds. Does this indicate Voxwana will become a more independent and important voice in the future of diamond marketing? Those are my questions. Catch me at the show if you have more to add or possible answers.
