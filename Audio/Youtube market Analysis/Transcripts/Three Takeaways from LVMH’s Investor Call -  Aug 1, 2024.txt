Now, let's get back to LVMH. First, the company gave quite a concerning view on the bridal jewelry market as CFO Jean-Jacques Guignolny said this segment was under pressure.  jewelry brand, where engagement rings are a major part of the US business. Inflation and higher interest rates have also put pressure on aspirational consumer spending in the US and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. This, again, has impacted Tiffany, which appeals to this segment of the market. Secondly, LVMH saw a strong surge in sales in Japan across the group. In jewelry and watches, Japan's share of global revenue increased to 13% from 10% a year earlier.  The rest of Asia saw its share slump to 30% from 37% a year before. This is because Chinese consumers have been travelling to Japan to capitalise on the weakness of the Japanese yen currency, Gionni explained. Today, each Chinese yuan buys about 3% more yen than two years ago. This situation creates challenges for LVMH, which reports its results in euros. It impacts the company's top and bottom lines, because each yen is worth fewer in euros than before.  This is why group sales rose at constant currency rates but decreased in reported terms. Also, Gionni said the speed of the weakening of the yen has made it hard to respond with price increases. This brings us to the third point.

While we already knew that sales in China were weak, especially in diamonds, this gives a new perspective on what's driving the consumer's lack of local spending. The sentiment from LVMH is consistent with reports we are hearing about luxury brands buying fewer diamonds than expected. This in turn is consistent with the recent declines in the prices of the top colour and clarity diamonds that the leading houses buy.  situation improve in time for the holiday season?
