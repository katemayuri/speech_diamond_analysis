 The Antwerp World Diamond Centre, or AWDC, has been through a lot of changes in recent months. First, it hired a new CEO, Karen Rente-Meesters, and appointed a new board and a new chairman, Izzy Myrtle, who I talked to a few weeks ago for one of our podcast episodes. And also, European Union import restrictions on Russian diamonds finally went into effect in January 2024. But there's another change that certainly passed me by until this week. The AWDC has resumed reporting its import and  export data, something it stopped doing in early 2022. That cessation coincided with the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, though it was never confirmed whether the war was the reason for it. An AWDC spokesperson told me the data started appearing again on its website for reasons of transparency around the time when the new board was appointed a couple of months ago. The numbers are based on data from the Diamond Office, the customs centre in Antwerp, for which goods passed when entering and leaving the European Union.  available for all the months back to when they stopped appearing more than two years ago.

This helps us a lot to get to know you better and keep making interesting content to help you navigate this industry. So let's look at some of the data that came in from the AWDC. In August 2024, Belgium's  Polish diamond exports fell 23% year on year by value. That's still a better performance than comparable markets such as Israel. The decline was pretty much in line with India's performance in July. Belgium's exports fell 13% year on year for the first 8 months of the year. If we focus on the trends over the months, we can see here that the year on year declines started the year at a sharp rate before easing in March, and in April, Belgium's Polish exports even showed growth. That was when the market looked to be in recovery mode.  we know things went downward from there, with exports falling again in May, and by the summer the numbers were quite bad again. Rough imports are a touchier subject given that Belgium used to be the number one destination for Russian diamonds. The AWDC doesn't break its rough data down by country of origin, but we know from the National Bank of Belgium that diamond imports from Russia slumped last year even before an import ban that went into effect on January 1st, 2024. We spoke about this in a video in July. Check it out at this link.  From the AWDC data, we also know that Belgium's rough imports slid 38% by value in the first 8 months of this year, reflecting the weak market, the dropping rough prices, as well as a lack of imports from Russia. This return to being open about statistics is a positive move for the market, and to hope that Long claim to be one of the most legitimate and transparent trading centres. It brings us back to the question of why it stopped for those 2.5 years after the Ukraine war began. That we can only guess.
