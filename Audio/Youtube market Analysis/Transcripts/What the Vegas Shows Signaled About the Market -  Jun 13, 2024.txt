 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market comment. We are back at our regular studio in Israel after my return from the JCK show in Las Vegas. I hope everyone who attended had a great time and got back safely. Before the show on May 23rd, I wrote down 5 things to look out for at the show. In this video, I'd like to review those points and see whether any questions were answered. The first question was, will people come? The answer to this is definitely yes, they did come.  though the attendance was not a record high. JCK Events reported that more than 17,300 people came, slightly down from the 18,000 it reported for last year's show. That was expected. The diamond market is in a challenging state, and the cost of hiring a booth has risen as have other expenses. Nonetheless, the reported number of exhibitors was steady at 1,900. However, what matters is the quality of the visitors and not just the volume. Exhibitors either  I spoke to said those who did attend were serious and this led to decent sales and inquiries, especially in the finished jewelry sections. Second, I asked how US retail was faring. I got a mix of answers. Many said consumers and retailers were shifting back to natural diamonds as I mentioned on the last video. Others pointed out uncertainty around the US economy and upcoming presidential elections. No one wants to be too optimistic about the market right now. Third, I asked what the industry thought about the beers.  This theme was not as prominent as I expected in the conversations participants had at the show. I don't think anyone can predict how the sale of De Beers could impact the industry. I asked De Beers CEO Al Cook whether the separation from Anglo-American might reduce De Beers' financial flexibility. This flexibility has enabled it to maintain industry stability in recent downturns, for example by limiting sales rather than lowering prices.  He said that the Beers had been an independent company for the vast majority of its history, and therefore this was not a concern. Fourth, I asked how the trade felt about sanctions on Russian diamonds. There was some sense of uncertainty and disillusionment with the plans that have been discussed, especially for requiring all diamonds to go to Belgium for inspection before entering G7 markets. There was also a lot of keenness to learn about the sanctions, as evidenced by the strong attendance at several of  events that dealt with these topics. Fifth and finally, I asked whether American diamond companies were able to compete with Indian suppliers. I'm going to hold my hand up and say I didn't get enough answers about this while I was in Vegas, so I'll leave this one open for you to send in your very valuable feedback on how this dynamic played out at the show.  is brought to you by Wrapnet, the world's largest and most trusted diamond trading network.
