 Hello and welcome to the Rappaport Market comment. A few weeks ago we talked about the divergent performance of higher and lower clarity diamonds in the current market. The recent holiday season indicated another split, this time between different retailers and the success of their strategies. Let's look at the only two major jewelry-focused retailers in the US that published sales results, Signet and Brilliant Earth. These two companies had very different  different experiences over the holiday season and in 2023 in general. We'll explore why that might be. Before we do that, let's see the results themselves.  line, its sales rose 4% year on year to $124.3 million for the fourth quarter and increased 1.5% to $446.4 million for the full year. Both companies were operating in the same challenging US retail environment. So why are their results so different? To understand we need to look at their business models. Cignaz is more invested in brick and mortar retail than in Brilliant Earth and has a history dating back more than 150 years. Brilliant Earth by  Contrast is focused on e-commerce, selling online while also enabling customers to view jewelry at physical showrooms. These numbered 37 at the end of 2023. Also, the company was founded in 2005 as a socially responsible brand catering to younger consumers. This connects the company with Millennials and Gen Z, especially in a time when these consumers are hunting for good deals online. Signet is around 15 times larger than Brilliant Earth in revenue terms.  This potentially makes Brilliant Earth nimbler, enabling it to adapt to trends faster and take more risks. Brilliant Earth CEO Beth Gerstein estimated that the company's 4-year revenue growth outperform the industry by 7.5% which she put down to the strong resonance of the brand.  conscious consumers. In an era of brands in the diamond industry as in many others, this appears to have helped the company outpace the market. Another hypothesis, this difference could also be caused by a general shift in the market towards fine jewellery and non-engagement related products. Brilliant Earth appears to have capitalised on this shift. The company doesn't break down sales by type of product, but singled out fine jewellery as the standout performer last year. This encompasses earrings, necklaces, braces and rings,  other than engagement or wedding rings. In its annual report, which it released last week, Brilliant Earth said customers typically begin their journey with Brilliant Earth by buying an engagement ring, but said it believes its brand messaging helped drive brand loyalty and future purchases. It also said investing in fine jewelry assortments was a way of capturing this goodwill. The trend in the market also explains Brilliant Earth's sales shift from value to volume. While sales value rose 1.5% last year, the total number of  orders increased 17% to almost $175,000. Brilliant Earth reported a 30% decline in the average order value amid greater sales of lower-priced products, including fine jewellery. Sales growth for products priced above $10,000 moderated. In contrast, Signif is more exposed to the engagement market through banners such as K Jewelers, Zales, Blue Nile, and James Allen. Those brands have built reputations over the years as the place to go  for engagement rings. Signet's bridal sales fell 10% to $3.13 billion last year. Management explained that a lull in dating during COVID-19 led to a recent slump in engagements, as we have said in past videos. Also, Signet has low exposure to the low-cost fashion jewelry segment. Signet CEO Gina Drossos acknowledged on an earnings call that this was the best performing part of the jewelry sector. The company's overall sales of fashion jewelry fell 9% year-on-year to $2.7 billion.  and six billion dollars last year. Drossos said Cygnet had an opportunity to develop that sector, especially in gold, where it has direct partnerships with factories. Cygnet and Brilliant Earth are two very different animals, but from their contrasting performances, we can learn a lot about how the jewelry market is faring.
